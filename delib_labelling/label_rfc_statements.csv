56375.0,"Downgrade to generally unreliable for science and politics – on a number of occasions I've come across Fox News being used as a source for politics and current affairs and been surprised. I believe it's generally accepted among mainstream experts and academics that Fox, the poster child for toxically partisan American media, is so unfailingly skewed it has individually had a significant impact on America's polarisation. I usually spend a few minutes seeing if I can remove it by finding another source. I've read other editors here arguing Fox is acceptable on a ""case-by-case"" basis for politics & science because it usually gets the most basic biographical facts right, but has Template:Tq is only for quoting in talk and project pages. Do not use it in actual articles.Category:Pages with incorrect formatting templates use (I see links below corroborating these frequent ""errors""). My view is that Fox News isn't reliable-biased because its bias seeps into, and subsumes, the entire process of its journalism, particularly fact selection and fact checking. This isn't a source we should ever be using for science articles. As for politics, Fox's mission to push an partisan viewpoint across its output causes several problems. By accepting Fox can occasionally be a acceptable source for information that can't be found elsewhere, we're indicating it occasionally falls within the spectrum of valuable mainstream opinion when other sources don't. I don't buy this. If Fox is saying something other sources aren't, I believe it's almost always because it's trying to push the public conversation in a partisan, non-expert led direction. For example, if I go to the Fox Politics page today the leading headline is ""Hunter Biden said he would be 'happy' to introduce business associates to top CCP official"". A source obsessed by partisan issues will skew our coverage away from a balance of expert opinion and the principle that Wikipedia is mainstream -- crucially, ""mainstream"" does not mean mass popular opinion, it means expert opinion. Fox may, very occasionally, hit on something most other outlets get it wrong, this is not a justification for its use, it's an indication of the flaws of academic bias we must accept to remain reflective of mainstream scholarship: we must trust mainstream sources to adjust and accept their mistake. To cite Fox taking an outlier position against the mainstream is very likely to result in contamination with misinformation and fringe views. To expect editors to be capable of determining valid, accurate encylopedic information in a mix of unfailingly skewed fact selection and outright falsehoods is impractical. And a source whose everyday purpose is satiating people who are angry, or making them angry about something new, isn't compatible with a serious, respected encylopedia. I don't support outright deprecation because I don't think there's any need to systematically remove existing links or ""prohibit it""; rather, we should be generally be avoiding further use and insisting editors have a higher minimum bar for politics and science sources. I'm not interested in arguments along the lines of ""but X is also biased""; in some cases I suspect this is whataboutism, and in some cases it may be valid, but it doesn't change the problem here: unfailing partisanship combined with frequent factual errors. Additionally, arguments such as ""Fox is rightwing, so banning it will lead to left-wing bias"" are also irrelevant to my stance, as I don't think Fox-style tabloid journalism is appropriate for a tertiary source whatever its political bent, and the mainstream of expertise should be determined by using academic sources (books/journals), not media outlets.

That was a concern when we moved from ""season"" to ""World Championship"" back in 2017. From memory, we made sure that we had as many participants in the discussion as possible and then bookmarked that discussion to refer anyone reverting it. It also helped that we moved thirty or so articles at once, and it was expected that with a bit of time, the number of reverts would decline. In fact, I don't think we ever had a single revert.

If we were to make changes, it would be with a clear understanding of the plan: that any article ""created"" from 2013 onwards would be changed and that anything pre-dating 2013 would be left alone. I still have two concerns, though:
 The subject of the affected articles are a physical thing which is owned and run by someone outside Wikipedia. This is opposed to a concept. As such, I think that some weight has to be given to Liberty/FOM. It's a bit like saying ""no, the Styrian Grand Prix should be called the second Austrian Grand Prix"".
 The range of sources presented within articles clearly use a style of naming. While WP:COMMONNAME says we should use the name that is reflected in most sources, the idea that we should use a name which is not in the sources presented undercuts that. It's the ""silent majority"" argument: that the majority of people agree with you, but haven't spoken up.

Among the six famines identified above, 1873 and 1943 provide some important insights. For instance, despite the monsoon failure and drought in 1873 in Bihar and Bengal provinces, there was minimal mortality (Hall‐Matthews, 2008). Moreover, human mortality was substantially higher in the other four droughts than in the 1873–1874 famine, which can be attributed to policy failures and mismanagement (Davis, 2001; Ferguson, 2004). The 1943 Bengal famine was not caused by drought but rather was a result of a complete policy failure during the British era.

44378.0,"Re @Seddon:, the intention of merging the WikiProjects is to unify all weather articles in the same project. There already is a lot of overlap, such as the map generator (used also by extratropical cyclones), links (think of NCDC or other links that are useful for TC's and all other weather types), and the fact that tropical cyclones often overlap with tornadoes, non-tropical storms, and floods. Having a larger weather project means more reviewers, and having more users in the same broad project means we could have more collaborations that otherwise might not have occurred. Sure, some people interested in tropical cyclones will still probably only edit tropical cyclones. That's fine. By that logic, we should just have a Wikiproject for Atlantic tropical cyclones, because there are people who only edit Atlantic tropical cyclones. I believe the WPTC has also run into a bit of a wall over the past few years. The global and historical coverage has gotten quite good, but that's only one small part of the picture. We still need a lot of top-down articles, such as lists by area (TC's in Bermuda), or lists by year. The lists by area work well alongside other weather types by area. If every article in the WPTC was a GA or FA, but the rest of the weather articles are only starts and stubs, then there is a huge gap on the website.

Often speculative future products get attention because of how that speculation reflects on the company or person who is speculating.
