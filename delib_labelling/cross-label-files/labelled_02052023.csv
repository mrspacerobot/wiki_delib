,"Downgrade to generally unreliable for science and politics â€“ on a number of occasions I've come across Fox News being used as a source for politics and current affairs and been surprised. I believe it's generally accepted among mainstream experts and academics that Fox, the poster child for toxically partisan American media, is so unfailingly skewed it has individually had a significant impact on America's polarisation. I usually spend a few minutes seeing if I can remove it by finding another source. I've read other editors here arguing Fox is acceptable on a ""case-by-case"" basis for politics & science because it usually gets the most basic biographical facts right, but has Template:Tq is only for quoting in talk and project pages. Do not use it in actual articles.Category:Pages with incorrect formatting templates use (I see links below corroborating these frequent ""errors""). My view is that Fox News isn't reliable-biased because its bias seeps into, and subsumes, the entire process of its journalism, particularly fact selection and fact checking. This isn't a source we should ever be using for science articles. As for politics, Fox's mission to push an partisan viewpoint across its output causes several problems. By accepting Fox can occasionally be a acceptable source for information that can't be found elsewhere, we're indicating it occasionally falls within the spectrum of valuable mainstream opinion when other sources don't. I don't buy this. If Fox is saying something other sources aren't, I believe it's almost always because it's trying to push the public conversation in a partisan, non-expert led direction. For example, if I go to the Fox Politics page today the leading headline is ""Hunter Biden said he would be 'happy' to introduce business associates to top CCP official"". A source obsessed by partisan issues will skew our coverage away from a balance of expert opinion and the principle that Wikipedia is mainstream -- crucially, ""mainstream"" does not mean mass popular opinion, it means expert opinion. Fox may, very occasionally, hit on something most other outlets get it wrong, this is not a justification for its use, it's an indication of the flaws of academic bias we must accept to remain reflective of mainstream scholarship: we must trust mainstream sources to adjust and accept their mistake. To cite Fox taking an outlier position against the mainstream is very likely to result in contamination with misinformation and fringe views. To expect editors to be capable of determining valid, accurate encylopedic information in a mix of unfailingly skewed fact selection and outright falsehoods is impractical. And a source whose everyday purpose is satiating people who are angry, or making them angry about something new, isn't compatible with a serious, respected encylopedia. I don't support outright deprecation because I don't think there's any need to systematically remove existing links or ""prohibit it""; rather, we should be generally be avoiding further use and insisting editors have a higher minimum bar for politics and science sources. I'm not interested in arguments along the lines of ""but X is also biased""; in some cases I suspect this is whataboutism, and in some cases it may be valid, but it doesn't change the problem here: unfailing partisanship combined with frequent factual errors. Additionally, arguments such as ""Fox is rightwing, so banning it will lead to left-wing bias"" are also irrelevant to my stance, as I don't think Fox-style tabloid journalism is appropriate for a tertiary source whatever its political bent, and the mainstream of expertise should be determined by using academic sources (books/journals), not media outlets.

That was a concern when we moved from ""season"" to ""World Championship"" back in 2017. From memory, we made sure that we had as many participants in the discussion as possible and then bookmarked that discussion to refer anyone reverting it. It also helped that we moved thirty or so articles at once, and it was expected that with a bit of time, the number of reverts would decline. In fact, I don't think we ever had a single revert.

If we were to make changes, it would be with a clear understanding of the plan: that any article ""created"" from 2013 onwards would be changed and that anything pre-dating 2013 would be left alone. I still have two concerns, though:

Among the six famines identified above, 1873 and 1943 provide some important insights. For instance, despite the monsoon failure and drought in 1873 in Bihar and Bengal provinces, there was minimal mortality (Hallâ€Matthews, 2008). Moreover, human mortality was substantially higher in the other four droughts than in the 1873â€“1874 famine, which can be attributed to policy failures and mismanagement (Davis, 2001; Ferguson, 2004). The 1943 Bengal famine was not caused by drought but rather was a result of a complete policy failure during the British era.

,"Re @Seddon:, the intention of merging the WikiProjects is to unify all weather articles in the same project. There already is a lot of overlap, such as the map generator (used also by extratropical cyclones), links (think of NCDC or other links that are useful for TC's and all other weather types), and the fact that tropical cyclones often overlap with tornadoes, non-tropical storms, and floods. Having a larger weather project means more reviewers, and having more users in the same broad project means we could have more collaborations that otherwise might not have occurred. Sure, some people interested in tropical cyclones will still probably only edit tropical cyclones. That's fine. By that logic, we should just have a Wikiproject for Atlantic tropical cyclones, because there are people who only edit Atlantic tropical cyclones. I believe the WPTC has also run into a bit of a wall over the past few years. The global and historical coverage has gotten quite good, but that's only one small part of the picture. We still need a lot of top-down articles, such as lists by area (TC's in Bermuda), or lists by year. The lists by area work well alongside other weather types by area.

These were made by AWB and seem to be the addition of talk pages and project templates to files that I uploaded such as [[File talk:Elspeth Henderson.png|this]].  I consider these to be quite annoying and my point is that the user appears to be making these edits just to boost his edit count rather than because they are useful or productive.  Is this a case of WP:POINT?  Does this guideline have any effect in deterring such behaviour?  And what if I were to revert all these vexatious additions?  Would that be a case of WP:POINT?  It doesn't seem that the guideline is any help in resolving such issues.  It's just clutter and complication for its own sake.  Just like all those project templates.

I think the problem is that you are misinterpreting what WP:USEBYOTHERS really is. It is a guideline that only applies to reliable sources that use other sources for facts, where ""widespread citation without comment for facts is evidence of a source's reputation and reliability for similar facts, whereas widespread doubts about reliability weigh against it."" In this case, none of the sources you gave is even citingLifeSiteNews as a source of fact, but rather as a source of interviews and quotes. If they did comment on the veracity of statements by LifeSiteNews, the chances are that the sources, liberal or conservative, would generally find them false.
If that makes me a ""liberal,"" I will tell you what I personally think of abortion: it is homicide, and I find it disturbingly painful how a publication that leans pro-choice but has journalistic ethics and credentials could be more trustworthy than one that is pro-life but lacks the integrity of a journalist (implying that pro-lifers like me are knowingly deceiving others about the controversialâ€”or morally questionable, as I would put itâ€”procedure). Unfortunately, something like that happens all too often, which makes me wonder whether some of them are actually anti-conservative or at least pro-choice trolls. If that still makes me a liberal, here is one source that I am comfortable citing. It is a pro-life editorial from the pro-life-leaning National Review. Though it has the headline ""California Shamelessly Persecutes Pro-Life Journalists"", admittedly the source does say that it is not because the convicts are pro-life (which by the way very likely would have been taken to the U.S. Supreme Court and struck down as unconstitutional). It is because they were engaged in secretly producing undercover recordings of conversations without consent. What particularly disturbs me, based on my observation, is that it seems to be against people producing such undercover recordings exposing possible illegal activity, on the basis that they are recordings of ""confidential conversations without knowledge or consent."" I cannot prove the authenticity of those recordings, nor can I prove that California's unusual decision to prosecute the undercover agents instead is politically motivated, but I would not be surprised if in the case of the latter it is partly because California was politically motivated, due to the state's reputation of embracing Democratic and progressive values.
Back on topic. Given that sources have used LifeSiteNews for its interviews, I would say that it is okay for interviews. Really, it is okay to use any source for interviews as long as we can prove that they are not fabricated.

I acknowledge that I lack anything like domain expertise, but it seems to me also that we risk falsely reifying ""the List"" here. Is there such a thing as the Sumerian King List, strictly speaking? It only becomes an issue if we insist on ""transcribing"" (that is, constructing) it. If we confine ourselves to discussing it, it suffices to inform the reader of the fragmentary and conflicting nature of the evidence; if we present an edition of ""the List"", we must source it, preferably to a source less than 80 years old.

,"OPPOSE This was previously discussed at Talk:Millennials/Archive_12#RfC_about_the_editing_the_lead_on_the_Millennials_article and the current wording reflects the consensus to arise out of that discussion. The article itself provides the range of 1980â€“1983 as the start years and 1995â€“2004 as the end years and I think the lead should summarise the full range of dates:
There is no definitive definition. If the lead just gives one hard date range such as 1981â€“1996 then Wikipedia is creating a de facto definition. Wikipedia should be following trends not setting them. If we put a single date in the lead then the simple fact is many people who consult the article will just go with the single date range.
MOS:LEAD advises that ""the emphasis given to material in the lead should roughly reflect its importance to the topic, according to reliable, published sources."" Considering that the date range is intrinsic to the definition then its imprecise nature is very relevant to the subject matter. The fact is there is a spread of dates and that should be reflected in the lead.
I disagree that giving a precise range gives the lead more precision. Precision is best attained here by conveying the vague nature of the definition.
The article states that the 1981â€“1996 range is a ""widely held definition"". This is not the same as a definitive definition. The same source also wrote """"generations are squishy concepts"".
The 1981â€“1996 date range is clearly the most important date range, but a substantial part of Millennials#Date_and_age_range_definitions covers alternative dates.
There are more sources for the 1981â€“1996 date range than there was during the last RFC, but this is partly down to advocates for these dates adding sources for these dates.
I did suggest a slight revision to the description in the lead in a section above: Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with 1981 to 1996 a widely accepted definition. I think it is the most important date range and am not against highlighting its prominence, but I think Wikipedia would be failing in its goals if it cherry-picked a date. Simply giving one date in the lead when there are others given in the article is problematic from the standpoint of readers who just skim the lead, search engines that just display the first paragraph of the lead etc.",0,0.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The UK is the correct term for the country, it is a unitary sovereign state, a founding member state of the United Nations, and is therefore, I would suggest, very reasonable to include on this basis. The logic you apply here would suggest that we should also remove ""U.S."" from the location field of appropriate boxes and replace with ""America"" - after all, very few Americans would say they come from ""the U.S."" over simply saying ""America"". However, the U.S. is the technically correct term, and as this is intended to be an encyclopaedia, I don't agree that we should apply an arbitrary approach based on what some people might or might not say. On that basis, I think the inclusion of ""UK"" after E/S/W/NI is perfectly reasonable as a compromise. I am certainly not suggesting throwing out E/S/W/NI.

,"Yes; MOS:COMMONALITY is an additional argument to make here.  â€”â€¯SMcCandlish â˜ Â¢ ðŸ˜¼  00:32, 24 June 2018 (UTC)
 Comment: ""Alma mater"" and ""Education"" are quite distinctly different terms, and I assume that is why both parameters often appear in the same infobox templates. From my limited perspective as an English-language speaker, having received 100% of my formal education in the United States, ""alma mater"" is always (and only) an institution of learning, and should never be confused with ""education"".  ""Education"", on the other hand, is the field of study + extent of that study, usually expressed in number of years completed or degrees earned, and the institution(s) is mostly irrelevant.  For example, ""I have a Masters degree in Information Technology.""  One might add to that, ""... from M.I.T."", because of the common presumption that this otherwise unrelated factoid reflects on the 'quality' of that education.  More commonly, however, institutions aren't salient when describing one's ""education"".  
I was surprised to hear from the original poster that ""alma mater"" "":Template:Xt is only for examples of style and formatting. Do not use it in actual articles.Category:Pages with incorrect formatting templates use"", so I looked at the linked Talk page discussion to learn more.  I found several people claiming they have never heard of the term, and several claiming they have, but only one source (Oxford English Dictionary) was produced, and it doesn't indicate where the phrase is most common.  The original poster also says, "":Template:Xt is only for examples of style and formatting. Do not use it in actual articles.Category:Pages with incorrect formatting templates use""  That also applies to Americans, who would never use ""alma mater"" to describe their education, because it only describes an institution.  Looking further at the alma mater article and the examples within, it appears to me that the term is anything but ""Americentric"".  When the original poster claims, "":Template:Xt is only for examples of style and formatting. Do not use it in actual articles.Category:Pages with incorrect formatting templates use"", I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the assertion that only Americans know the difference between ""education"" and ""alma mater"".  If we're just working from personal perception and experience here, I guess mine is different.
If the ultimate intent is to remove the |alma_mater= parameter from infoboxes (-boxen?), I think a much better argument would be that it isn't really a ""key"" factoid deserving of infobox real estate.  It's a rarely used term in American English, too, after all.  And SMcCandlish raises some good points about the field being prone to misuse and misapplication.  I have no particular attachment to the parameter, but I can't bring myself to vote for removal if the reasoning is the anecdotal and unsupported ""alma mater is very Americentric"" assertion.",0,0.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Nothing about the proposed wording that I supported (A) implies that Senedd Cymru is not part of the formal name of the institution. It only indicates that it is Welsh, which, indeed, it is!

Also, sometimes it may be a valid complaint, but some issue arises with the process. E.g. with the timing, an editor takes out a valid case, but does it at exactly the right moment to delay or obstruct some action against them, or to distract from a case they are losing. Or it could be that they do it without first attempting to resolve the problem editor's behaviour amicably. In both cases the action is valid, they had just cause, but there are issues with the process itself. Such cases could involve discussing whether the way the other editor behaved was appropriate. In some cases there might be issues with the admins as well.

In addition to all that, the thing is also, that we want it to be a friendly place, so if an editor comes to the board, raging / scared / anxious etc, the first thing is to help them to calm down and focus on what they can do constructively. That is unless of course it is obviously libelous or some such where it just can't be permitted at all. And that's another way in which the board can help, and no amount of documentation can provide that human touch of someone to just listen to their case. Sometimes all they may need is someone to listen and then they figure out what to do next by themselves. 

So, at that point, first comers to the board, I think them just saying a few bad things about other editors should be treated with a bit of leniency. Like listening to a friend who is in trouble.
