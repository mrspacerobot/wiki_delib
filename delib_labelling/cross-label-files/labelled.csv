It is a guideline that only applies to reliable sources that use other sources for facts, where ""widespread citation without comment for facts is evidence of a source's reputation and reliability for similar facts, whereas widespread doubts about reliability weigh against it."" In this case, none of the sources you gave is even citingLifeSiteNews as a source of fact, but rather as a source of interviews and quotes. If they did comment on the veracity of statements by LifeSiteNews, the chances are that the sources, liberal or conservative, would generally find them false.
If that makes me a ""liberal,"" I will tell you what I personally think of abortion: it is homicide, and I find it disturbingly painful how a publication that leans pro-choice but has journalistic ethics and credentials could be more trustworthy than one that is pro-life but lacks the integrity of a journalist (implying that pro-lifers like me are knowingly deceiving others about the controversialâ€”or morally questionable, as I would put itâ€”procedure). Unfortunately, something like that happens all too often, which makes me wonder whether some of them are actually anti-conservative or at least pro-choice trolls. If that still makes me a liberal, here is one source that I am comfortable citing. It is a pro-life editorial from the pro-life-leaning National Review. Though it has the headline ""California Shamelessly Persecutes Pro-Life Journalists"", admittedly the source does say that it is not because the convicts are pro-life (which by the way very likely would have been taken to the U.S. Supreme Court and struck down as unconstitutional). It is because they were engaged in secretly producing undercover recordings of conversations without consent. What particularly disturbs me, based on my observation, is that it seems to be against people producing such undercover recordings exposing possible illegal activity, on the basis that they are recordings of ""confidential conversations without knowledge or consent."" I cannot prove the authenticity of those recordings, nor can I prove that California's unusual decision to prosecute the undercover agents instead is politically motivated, but I would not be surprised if in the case of the latter it is partly because California was politically motivated, due to the state's reputation of embracing Democratic and progressive values.
Back on topic. Given that sources have used LifeSiteNews for its interviews, I would say that it is okay for interviews. Really, it is okay to use any source for interviews as long as we can prove that they are not fabricated.

I still don't understand just what it is we gain by retaining this version of the information, whether here or elsewhere. This version appears inferior to that at List of Mesopotamian dynasties along a few dimensions: it is a subset of the latter version, it conceals OR synthesis and editorial decisions, it is sparsely cited, and appears to rely more heavily on outdated sources. I acknowledge that I lack anything like domain expertise, but it seems to me also that we risk falsely reifying ""the List"" here. Is there such a thing as the Sumerian King List, strictly speaking? It only becomes an issue if we insist on ""transcribing"" (that is, constructing) it. If we confine ourselves to discussing it, it suffices to inform the reader of the fragmentary and conflicting nature of the evidence; if we present an edition of ""the List"", we must source it, preferably to a source less than 80 years old. But all this is kind of beside the point, because as far as I can see the work has already been done, over at List of Mesopotamian dynasties. Again, why isn't that enough? Why don't we just point readers over there? What is the special sauce? With respect, is this just fetishizing the ancient clay with the booming resonant name? THE SUMERIAN KING LIST [gong splash].

 Comment: ""Alma mater"" and ""Education"" are quite distinctly different terms, and I assume that is why both parameters often appear in the same infobox templates. From my limited perspective as an English-language speaker, having received 100% of my formal education in the United States, ""alma mater"" is always (and only) an institution of learning, and should never be confused with ""education"".  ""Education"", on the other hand, is the field of study + extent of that study, usually expressed in number of years completed or degrees earned, and the institution(s) is mostly irrelevant.  For example, ""I have a Masters degree in Information Technology.""  One might add to that, ""... from M.I.T."", because of the common presumption that this otherwise unrelated factoid reflects on the 'quality' of that education.  More commonly, however, institutions aren't salient when describing one's ""education"".  
I was surprised to hear from the original poster that ""alma mater"" "":Template:Xt is only for examples of style and formatting. Do not use it in actual articles.Category:Pages with incorrect formatting templates use"", so I looked at the linked Talk page discussion to learn more.  I found several people claiming they have never heard of the term, and several claiming they have, but only one source (Oxford English Dictionary) was produced, and it doesn't indicate where the phrase is most common.  The original poster also says, "":Template:Xt is only for examples of style and formatting. Do not use it in actual articles.Category:Pages with incorrect formatting templates use""  That also applies to Americans, who would never use ""alma mater"" to describe their education, because it only describes an institution.  Looking further at the alma mater article and the examples within, it appears to me that the term is anything but ""Americentric"".  When the original poster claims, "":Template:Xt is only for examples of style and formatting. Do not use it in actual articles.Category:Pages with incorrect formatting templates use"", I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the assertion that only Americans know the difference between ""education"" and ""alma mater"".  If we're just working from personal perception and experience here, I guess mine is different.
If the ultimate intent is to remove the |alma_mater= parameter from infoboxes (-boxen?), I think a much better argument would be that it isn't really a ""key"" factoid deserving of infobox real estate.  It's a rarely used term in American English, too, after all.  And SMcCandlish raises some good points about the field being prone to misuse and misapplication.  I have no particular attachment to the parameter, but I can't bring myself to vote for removal if the reasoning is the anecdotal and unsupported ""alma mater is very Americentric"" assertion.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In fact, anyone who understands how the community works would not be puzzled by what is coming down, so she simply does not yet understand, that's all. She thought it was her job to have the WMF promote the interests of the millions of readers.

meta.wikimedia,"@Ca2james:  On your other point - yes in an ideal system with perfectly applied justice, the only person at fault is the topic banned editor. But you will always have some miscarriages of justice, as after all there would be no need for appeal if the system was perfect. 

Also, sometimes it may be a valid complaint, but some issue arises with the process. E.g. with the timing, an editor takes out a valid case, but does it at exactly the right moment to delay or obstruct some action against them, or to distract from a case they are losing. Or it could be that they do it without first attempting to resolve the problem editor's behaviour amicably. In both cases the action is valid, they had just cause, but there are issues with the process itself. Such cases could involve discussing whether the way the other editor behaved was appropriate. In some cases there might be issues with the admins as well.

In addition to all that, the thing is also, that we want it to be a friendly place, so if an editor comes to the board, raging / scared / anxious etc, the first thing is to help them to calm down and focus on what they can do constructively. That is unless of course it is obviously libelous or some such where it just can't be permitted at all. And that's another way in which the board can help, and no amount of documentation can provide that human touch of someone to just listen to their case. Sometimes all they may need is someone to listen and then they figure out what to do next by themselves. 

So, at that point, first comers to the board, I think them just saying a few bad things about other editors should be treated with a bit of leniency. Like listening to a friend who is in trouble. In just this board, for the first few comments, so long as they show that their reason for coming to the board is to seek help. I think that would become clear quite quickly. If they do, they will be glad to be guided in the direction of more constructive conversation as that's what they came there for. I did actually work out several different sets of ideas for ways of dealing with situations like this during the proposal discussions, in considerable detail indeed,  but @Darkfrog24: I think wisely suggested we don't put these into the mockup but leave it just as <<GUIDELINES PENDING>>. There would also for sure be some situations where the conversation has to continue via email so they don't have to say things publicly, and we have also discussed this.

It turns the sister projects from being potentially productive environments to hives of trolling and stupidity and editing solely to make a point. I believe in second chances: there are people who have left enwiki and gone on to do great work on other projects.
