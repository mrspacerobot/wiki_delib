"Probably not. My tentative analysis: the WMF hired an Executive Director who, no surprise, had very little wiki experience. She may be an excellent executive, but will need sound advice, and she wasn't getting it from the Staff, which has, as is common with Staff at nonprofits, its own agenda. It's going to take her some time to sort this, I expect. On her talk page here, she professed puzzlement at what was happening. In fact, anyone who understands how the community works would not be puzzled by what is coming down, so she simply does not yet understand, that's all. She thought it was her job to have the WMF promote the interests of the millions of readers. Maybe, that could be part of it, but not at the expense of the core mission, damaging the engine that truly runs the wikis, without which the WMF would need a lot more money.

"@Ca2james:  On your other point - yes in an ideal system with perfectly applied justice, the only person at fault is the topic banned editor. But you will always have some miscarriages of justice, as after all there would be no need for appeal if the system was perfect. 

Also, sometimes it may be a valid complaint, but some issue arises with the process. E.g. with the timing, an editor takes out a valid case, but does it at exactly the right moment to delay or obstruct some action against them, or to distract from a case they are losing. Or it could be that they do it without first attempting to resolve the problem editor's behaviour amicably. In both cases the action is valid, they had just cause, but there are issues with the process itself. Such cases could involve discussing whether the way the other editor behaved was appropriate. In some cases there might be issues with the admins as well.

In addition to all that, the thing is also, that we want it to be a friendly place, so if an editor comes to the board, raging / scared / anxious etc, the first thing is to help them to calm down and focus on what they can do constructively. That is unless of course it is obviously libelous or some such where it just can't be permitted at all. And that's another way in which the board can help, and no amount of documentation can provide that human touch of someone to just listen to their case. Sometimes all they may need is someone to listen and then they figure out what to do next by themselves. 

So, at that point, first comers to the board, I think them just saying a few bad things about other editors should be treated with a bit of leniency. Like listening to a friend who is in trouble. In just this board, for the first few comments, so long as they show that their reason for coming to the board is to seek help. I think that would become clear quite quickly. If they do, they will be glad to be guided in the direction of more constructive conversation as that's what they came there for. I did actually work out several different sets of ideas for ways of dealing with situations like this during the proposal discussions, in considerable detail indeed,  but @Darkfrog24: I think wisely suggested we don't put these into the mockup but leave it just as <<GUIDELINES PENDING>>. There would also for sure be some situations where the conversation has to continue via email so they don't have to say things publicly, and we have also discussed this.

"To me this has become less about the implementation of a particular piece of software, but the lack of respect if not outright contempt the board has shown to the community. The board speaks of having to act in order to maintain the position of Wikipedia as a ""top-5 website"", without asking themselves how the site became a top 5 website in the first place? May I suggest that it became so because of content, and that this content was created because users found the right mix of tools and culture to be willing to give of themselves. A great part of the wikimedia culture, though not much articulated, is egalitarianism, that all are welcome to edit, that all are equally valued for their contributions, and that all have a voice in how and in which direction the community should go, and from this consensus is built. However what superprotect tells us is that not all are equal, that there exist those who stand above us and rule us, that there is a Great Helmsman and his minions who will guide the ship to where they desire and that those of us who disagree with the direction can either like it or lump it.

"The German Wikipedia has a list of streets and places in Berlin-Halensee. For the purposes of the German Wikipedia the streets aren't individually notable but for our purposes they are clearly identifiable conceptual or material entities that can be described using serious and publicly available references and thus is are notable.
That means an item like Cicerostra√üe (Q30076706) has a place on Wikidata. The item can be linked from OpenStreetMap.

The German article that lists the street contains interesting information for someone who wants to know about Cicerostra√üe (Q30076706). It tells the reader that the street got it's name on 8. Jan. 1892 and is named after Johann Cicero while it was previously named Stra√üe 41. It's useful for a reader who comes to Wikidata from OpenStreetMap to have the redirect to be able to continue to the German Wikipedia.

Whenever Wikidata has a higher resolution than Wikipedia, redirects are useful. Wikidata can have entries for all ICD illnesses but the individual Wikipedia often batch multiple ICD numbers together to a single article. It's useful to still have links from Wikidata to the Wikipedia article that describe the illnesses even when 

Won't this cause the individual redirects to create more redirects than they currently do? Yes, it would and that's great.

Leadstories clearly says, ""Did Special Counsel John Durham's court filings say the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016 paid to have servers in Trump Tower and in the White House infiltrated in hopes of establishing a link between Russian operatives and Donald J. Trump? No, that's not true: neither the new filing nor the indictment Durham filed in 2021 about events in 2016 say anyone infiltrated White House or Trump Tower servers."" ""Durham, the Special Counsel that Trump's attorney general, Bill Barr, appointed to investigate how the FBI acted on what turned out to be false premises, makes it clear that Sussman, an attorney paid both by the Clinton campaign and an un-named pro-Clinton tech executive, didn't have success documenting a Trump/Russian Bank connection. Nor the indictment -- against a lawyer who simultaneously worked for the Clinton campaign and for a pro-Clinton tech executive -- nor the new filing say that Trump Tower and White House servers were infiltrated at all."" ""The indictment filed by Durham charges Sussman with lying, but not actual infiltration of private Trump servers and does not mention White House servers at all"" Clearly false and slanted reporting by Fox.

"I don't want any tiptoeing in WP- quite the contrary.  I would like due respect paid to those who were killed by Lenin's government, so the mealy-mouthed elements of this article should go.  When somebody suggests that 'reunited' is not an appropriate word for those countries conquered by Lenin, that's not anti-Lenin.  When I suggest that Lenin's imperialist actions are far more important than his anti-imperialist speeches, that's not anti-Lenin.  MBO and JU have consistently fought against these sort of changes being made, in the apparent belief that triangulation between the facts and some PR spin is a NPOV.  When I make an edit to clarify that only one cite asserts that Lenin was demonized, that's following the sources, it's not being anti-Lenin.  When I make an edit to show that various countries that achieved their independence around 1920 did so despite armed attempts to squash them by Lenin, that's not anti-Lenin.  (The previous wording, in this -oh-so-wonderful FA article, defended by MBO, suggested that it was by Lenin's graciousness that they achieved independence.)  When I say that Lenin's cult differed from Washington's in that the population of the USA was not cowed by terror into going along with the personality cult, that's not anti-Lenin.  There is indeed a pattern here, and its not an anti-Lenin pattern by me and others, it's let's-not-use-a-nasty-word-for-a-nasty-act by MBO.  There's the tiptoeing, and there's the bias.

"[[User: Robert McClenon]];
After going through the entire discussion one thing which was evident is that, there is a debate between the proponents CherryPie94 and Lizzydarcy2008 on the fact that The King: Eternal Monarch is a successful drama or not. Facts/opinionated facts and changes proposed by Lizzydarcy2008 mostly seems to be flattery and pleasant to read, on the other side, facts/opinionated facts proposed by CherryPie94 seems to be quite exaggerated on both positive and negative aspects of drama's reception making it to seem neutral. 
One topic which was touched  many times was the popularity of this drama outside South Korea. I myself a regular Kdrama watcher can say that: Yes, The King: Eternal Monarch was a popular drama overseas but others kdramas like Crash Landing on You and It's Okay to Not Be Okay were more popular overseas. Even considering it to be a important reason for its less viewership rating on TV is absurd. It can be said that drama was popular overseas and can be considered as a part of its success but regarding it as strong point/stand for lower viewership is not quite believable. Even the source added to make this fact acceptable is a topic of debate should not be added in neutral articles of Wikipedia. Dramas like Itaewon Class and Crash Landing on You also aired on online streaming sites like TVing and Netflix simultaneously with TV but still recorded strong ratings throughout their run. Even if you disregard my opinion on the fact of viewership the facts stated are true. 
As a conclusion, if I have to choose between the two proposed changes I will go with proponent CherryPie94.
