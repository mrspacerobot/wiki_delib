And I think that a concensus need to be found before the growing of the database.\n\nIf the consensus is difficult to be founded, I think it might be a good idea to make a vote with a section for each namespaces (Category, Help, Wikipedia and User).\n\nPersonally, I think that only article pages have to be included into Wikidata because:\n# Wikidata is done before everything to store data about real entities (a person, a city...) not to store languages links of WIkipedias.\n# Mediawiki will ever manage interlanguages links (because Mediawiki is not used only by Wikimedia's wikis) so there are no technical need to move all links to Wikidata.\n# Wikidata will output a lot of lists in the future that will reduce the importance of the categories and so the utility of categories. Importance languageslinks between category will be reduce.\n# Pages of the Wikipedia namespace are very Wikipedia-specific and Wikidata is, I think, done to work will all Wikimedia wikis.\n# The Wikimedia Fondation will work on a [[mw:GlobalProfile|Global Profile]] system that will links all users pages of a user. The need of interwiki for user pages will be reduce.\n[[User:Tpt|Tpt]] ([[User talk:Tpt|talk]]) 10:20, 31 October 2012 (UTC)\n: Not sure about the Categories. I believe, they should be included. \n:#It will be a lot easier to have one system inside wikipedia. \n:#If we don't include categories we could also question the inclusion of disambiguation pages. \n:#When I look at the road map, the first goal for wikidata is to include interwiki.\n:[[User:Zil|Zil]] ([[User talk:Zil|talk]]) 10:34, 31 October 2012 (UTC)\n::I for one don't see the value of using Wikidata for user pages, categories etc..

The fact that categories will be superseded by the new output may be disputed, we will still need it on the projects, so we will need links between categories too. Same with the other namespace. The only one I don't see the point in including it is the User namespace, apart from any consideration on the Global profile system. --[[User:Sannita|Sannita]] - <small>''[[User talk:Sannita|not just another it.wiki sysop]]''</small> 10:45, 31 October 2012 (UTC)\n:::@Soulkeeper: You may be right, but please consider that Wikidata will be useful also for non-Wikipedia projects... what it may seem to be useless on Wikipedia, may be useful on other WMF projects - or to other projects outside WMF \"jurisdiction\".

As for the scope, I think it is just a matter of setting up new namespaces ([[mw:Manual:$wgExtraNamespaces|$wgExtraNamespaces]]) on Wikidata for things which are not the \"main\" content of Wikidata (as a project for more than just WMF wikis), but are still an important content for (one or more) WMF wikis. If needed, we can discusss inclusion criteria for each of these extra namespaces, and wether thei will be considered as content namespaces ([[mw:Manual:$wgContentNamespaces|$wgContentNamespaces]]) or not. [[b:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 16:02, 3 November 2012 (UTC)\n:It's good to adopt Wikidata for all namespace, but the actual items should not be confused with those of other namespaces. [[User:Raoli|Raoli]] ([[User talk:Raoli|talk]]) 17:41, 4 November 2012 (UTC)\n:+1 on Helder's proposal. Looks to me as a good compromise. --[[User:Sannita|Sannita]] - <small>''[[User talk:Sannita|not just another it.wiki sysop]]''</small> 11:30, 5 November 2012 (UTC)\n:I supported this already somewhere else, so I support also here. --[[User:Stryn|Stryn]] ([[User talk:Stryn|talk]]) 11:48, 5 November 2012 (UTC)\n\nThe idea and design of Wikidata is that of an ''entity base'': a catalog of ''things'', ''ideas'', or ''concepts''. For each concept, there should be exactly one item. Having one item corresponding to [[:en:Germany]] and another to [[:en:Category:Germany]] would be very bad indeed. If links between Wikipedia categories are needed, they should be introduced as separate link group from the site links to Wikipedia Articles. This would allow every item to have one link to a Wikipeda article and one to a Wikipedia category (per language).\n\nFor connecting user pages, help pages, etc... it can be done, but there will be problems. For instance, if there is a Wikiepdia for whom there also exists an article (say, [[:en:User:Jimmy Wales]] and [[:en:Jimmy Wales]]), there should still be only one item for Jimmy - because both these pages are ''about the same thing''. The problem is that the data item can only link to one of those pages.\n\n{{tracked|41895}}\nMaybe the solution would be to allow each item to have one link to a Wikipedia page per language ''per namespace''. This way, the Wikipedia article, category and portal about Germany could be linked with [[Q183]]. Thinking about it, this seems to be the only clean solution to me. It does mean some changes to the software (and to the API though), I'm not sure whether we can afford this right now. -- [[User:Daniel Kinzler (WMDE)|Daniel Kinzler (WMDE)]] ([[User talk:Daniel Kinzler (WMDE)|talk]]) 20:22, 5 November 2012 (UTC)\n:If this is doable, I would support this \"one link per namespace\" idea (though in the longer term, it sounds desirable to get rid of categories) For Commons it would be very convenient indeed, as there is often disagreements as to whether we should link Commons categories to Wikipedia articles or Wikipedia categories. --[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|talk]]) 20:51, 5 November 2012 (UTC)\n::I agree with Daniel Kinzler.

Just as 'Germany' is different from 'Germania' and 'Germans' and 'German culture'.   We need a flexible way to identify connection between different entities.  But it would be wrong to suggest that the same string means identical things across different namespaces.  (Talk: may be an exception -- it is already treated specially in the list of NS'es for this reason.)\n:::   I left a detailed comment on the bug: In particular, if A is a translation of B,  Category:A may not be a translation of Category:B,  and Project:A may will often not be the right translation of Project:B.    \n::: What system is being used to define the connection between the entities \"Male X\" and \"Female X\" or \"X (singular)\" and \"X (plural)\" ?

While these goals mostly overlap, in certain cases they do not, such as in non-mainspace pages and disambiguation pages. Additionally, in both of these the setup we use for actual data items does not work well (they have no use for labels or descriptions) and can cause confusion. For example, [[Q16503|Wikipedia:Village pump (Q16503)]] does not actually link to an article about the described entity, it links to the entity itself. This is the case for all categories, templates, project pages, main pages, disambiguation pages, and user pages. This is far from an optimal situation. So, I propose the following:\n*Each item should include a metadata property indicating whether it connects to an actual entity/topic or not.\n*All items that do not connect to an entity have their label and description field eliminated/disabled.\n*These items become represented in RC and so on using their associated wiki page's title as opposed to a label.\n*These items are separated somewhat from the regular items. For example, they might be excluded in search unless the user searching specifies otherwise.\nThoughts? --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 12:26, 19 November 2012 (UTC)\n:{{support}} You're right! ... they are my same thoughts. :) [[User:Raoli|Raoli]] ([[User talk:Raoli|talk]]) 12:49, 19 November 2012 (UTC)\n:{{support}} I agree that such \"interwiki hubs\" should be kept separate from actual items.

There's only one real entity (Spain) and two properties for each language: the interwiki to Wikipedia article ''and'' the interwiki to Wikipedia category. This real world relation is nowadays kept in English Wikipedia by {{tl|Cat main}}.

The final solution they came up with was both simple and good: sets could contain anything, including other sets; and there is only one kind of set.\n::: In this case: there are both digital and non-digital things in the world.  Non-digital things naturally are not themselves online.  But digital things can be; so perhaps we need two different sorts of objects.   Anything in the world can have a summary of itself on Wikipedia and a snapshot of itself on Commons, and a category of things related to it.  Digital works might themselves directly be on a wiki: they night *be* a page (a Spanish Wikisource transcription of ''[[s:es:Hamlet|Hamlet]]'', or French Wikivoyage coverage of [[wikivoyage:fr:Paris|Paris]]), and those might relate to *other* pages (the Spanish encyclopedia summary of ''[[w:es:Hamlet|Hamlet]]'', the French Wikiquote page about [[q:fr:Paris|Paris]]), which might go on to refer to non-digital physical (or legendary) concepts or things.  \n::: Every Wikidata entry should be an entity or concept.  All we need to do is to capture links between different entities that are strongly related.  For instance, we shouldn't really link the abstract entry for \"Paris\" directly to \"encyclopedia articles about Paris\".  After all, there are countless ways to describe Paris, and only one of them looks like a Wikipedia article.  Instead the abstract entry for Paris should link to all of the different entities related to Paris, including \"Wikipedia pages about Paris\", \"Wikimedia Commons pages about Paris\", \"Wikivoyage pages about Paris\", \"Category of Wikipedia topics related to Paris\", \"Category of Wikimedia Commons images related to Paris\", \"Interface messages titled 'Paris' \", &c.  The more specific these subentities can be, the better.  Because there are actually thousands of sites out there with information, pages, and categories about and rleated to Paris; and all should be welcome to have Wikidata entries if someone wants to add them.  \n::: We should avoid overloading the main, unqualified namespace here in a way that makes the project as a whole useless to any project but Wikipedia.

For example, it takes me a pretty long time to prepare a list like the \"List of Flemish painters\" or \"List of protected heritage in Wallonia\", and ultimately, there will be tooling that will turn such Wikipedia pages into simple \"hooks\" into Wikidata that produce the text of the list on demand for the reader. The advantage will be that all the work on the list items can be shared across projects immediately and will no longer be dependant on some individual editor in one Wikipedia project. So my take away from this discussion is 1) go ahead and create the Wikidata items for the lists, as the wikipedia pages will always exist, no matter whether there is simple text or \"Wikidata hooks\" in them. [[User:Jane023|Jane023]] ([[User talk:Jane023|talk]]) 18:55, 26 January 2013 (UTC)\n\n==Category pages==\nThe information in the Wikidata infoboxes should mean the Wikidata search function can produce all (well most of) the 'Category' information without using the Wikipedia Categories at all. Categories which can't be found that way are mostly to do with management of the projects and probably don't need interlanguage links. Do we need these on Wikidata? [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 03:48, 7 January 2013 (UTC)\n:Yes, in a way. I believe categories will still be very important on projects. More, on Italian Wikipedia, we usually have lots of problems in getting the interlinks between categories. So, yes, we need categories to be included here.\n:A couple of months ago, it was suggested to probably have a dedicated namespace for that. I don't know if it's possible, but it could be a solution. --[[User:Sannita|Sannita]] - <small>''[[User talk:Sannita|not just another it.wiki sysop]]''</small> 01:03, 12 January 2013 (UTC)\n:{{support}} - One major problem with the categorization system is that when a category is renamed, it's either deleted or replaced with a soft redirect, both of which break the incoming links. A few times we (on English Wikipedia) had a category redirects or category disambiguations spammed with the interwiki links from other wikis (see [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Georgian_people&dir=prev&offset=20090316001433&limit=20&action=history here] for a nice example), and frequently the links are deleted just to be re-added a few hours/days later. Migrating the category interwiki to here should, in my opinion, make things easier. Additionally, if we have a category with many incoming interwiki links, then renaming it requires lots of edits to many wikis - and thise all need to be done now; with a central repository, it's a single edit (and perhaps category renaming bots can be programmed to do it automaticly when renaming categories).

Let's take the example of France: it would connect with the items \"Country\", \"French language\", \"Europe\", \"NATO\", etc. Then we could produce the searches \"francophone countries of europe\", or \"NATO countries of europe\" and then we'd have the same information as we have now with categories. Categories without an associated article mean that they are better used as Properties (infobox information), so no big deal if we get rid of that kind of categories or we mass import that information as item properties. \nThe downside is that without categories we might lose the recommendation system they offer.

As such, if a user starts a vote for removal of adminship on [[WD:RFP]], the admin in question should require 75% support to retain the tools (75% opposed to the desysopping vote). This will create a clear desysopping procedure which requires no RfC, no long discussions, just a simple second RfA. These requests for removal of adminship would normally last 1-2 weeks, but can be speedy-closed if it is clear that there will be consensus to keep the tools. </s>\n\nPer my comment below, changing this to a request for removal of adminship requiring 50% support to pass (and remove the sysop bit from a person), which would happen only after a discussion on [[Wikidata:Administrators' noticeboard]].

As you say, that might still happen if they are temporary (or permanent, with consensus for a future reconfirmation, if that technicality makes life easier for the stewards), but at least in the latter scenario we can hold such people to account when their reconfirmation takes place.

Having a vote at that time might be even worse, since all of the people with the less-than-honourable motivation are already present, whereas in six months after the confirmations, many of those users would have hopefully lost the sysop bit and thus have no interest in the situation (hence my earlier remark of a more objective outcome).

They are still active on \"my\" project hunting X-wiki-vandals and spammers. They do nothing else than that today, if we don't request their actions of course. Nobody here has told about any local problems relating to them, and I cannot see any language-related problem other than can exist for any local admin on a multi-lang-project like this. They are not authorised to interpret consensus in a RfP, not more than any average user are, so I see no problem.

Lewis]] ([[User talk:John F. Lewis|talk]]) 20:20, 3 July 2013 (UTC)}}\n''(See [[Wikidata:Wikimedia Commons]] for other discussions about Commons.)''\n\nI think, an item page should aggregate interwikis of articles with interwikis of categories of identic item. E. g. [[Q36433]] (Porto) should be merged with [[Q1366]] (Category:Porto). Such solution would enable better interconnection of categories with their main articles and can be also a key how to involve Commons to Wikidata (Commons categories combine links to Wikipedia articles with links to Wikipedia categories and this Wikidata solution can solve the collision systematically.) It's suitable especially for categories of individual subjects and abstracts concepts (generally, with names in singular). Group (plural) categories can be treated in a similar way but the relation is more complicated \u2013 they have often no exact article equivalent \u2013 [[:en:Category:Capitals|Category:Capitals]] could be somehow connected with [[Q2187749|List of capitals]] as well as with [[Q5119|Capital city]]) but I'm not sure that they should be merged to identic item. \n\nI think, the item page can have two main blocks of interwikis: \n* List of pages linked to this item (one allready)\n* List of categories linked to this item (should be added/differentiated). \nThis solution can be inspirative also for incorporation of some other Wikimedia projects. \n--[[User:\u0160J\u016f|\u0160J\u016f]] ([[User talk:\u0160J\u016f|talk]]) 15:48, 12 March 2013 (UTC)\n\n:Category:Porto is a category for articles related to Porto. Meaning there's some kind of semantic relation between Porto and the other articles in the category. On Wikipedia, that was the best we could do. On Wikidata, we can do much better. Specifically, we can make semantic statements in the items for the Category:Porto articles that relate those items to Porto. Then, if one wants a list of items related to Porto, such a list will be able to be produced automatically. Therefore, from the point of view of Wikidata, the item Category:Porto is meaningless and only exists as a Wikipedia artifact. Since I suspect many, if not all WP categories are used similarly, I think there's no reason to have WD items for them. If anything, Wikipedia should evolve from using categories towards using Wikidata as a source for what the categories are currently trying to do. [[User:Silver hr|Silver hr]] ([[User talk:Silver hr|talk]]) 20:54, 12 March 2013 (UTC)\n\n::Also the article \"Porto\" cannot be a pure essence of Porto but it is \"only\" a container of information about (related to) Porto \u2013 similarly as the \"Category:Porto\". Both are \"artefacts\", the articles as well as the categories. Both are defined by identic item. From the semantic view, the article specifies the item similarly as the category \u2013 the distinction is only in the form of the information. However, the real content of the article is structured very similarly as the content of the category. I doubt that WD needs two different pages for one identic item. That's why I suggest to include both groups of interwikis into one item page. \n\n::It is a bit rash to consider categorization system as \"meaningless\". I'm sure, meaning of categories is not so difficult to understand, and categorization can be fully compatible and symbiotic with WD data structure \u2013 if WD will be not developed with ignorance and destruction of all time-proven. --[[User:\u0160J\u016f|\u0160J\u016f]] ([[User talk:\u0160J\u016f|talk]]) 22:15, 12 March 2013 (UTC)\n\n:::Fully support to the idea by \u0160J\u016f. In fact, Mediawiki developers could have chosen to use only one page for both the article ''and'' its category, seeming as if it would be a navigation template for the article. Wikidata ''must'' record primarily real world items, and Porto and Category:Porto are about the same real world item. --[[User:Rondador|Ronda]][[User Talk:Rondador|dor]] 21:54, 13 March 2013 (UTC)\n\n:::Perhaps my remark about Category:Porto being meaningless as a WD item wasn't explained too well, I'll try to clarify. In Wikipedia such categories do provide meaning, a semantic grouping if you will. But in Wikidata we can specify the exact semantic relation between items via the use of properties instead of a vague \"this item is somehow related to that item\" that such Wikipedia categories provide. Therefore, Wikidata goes way above and beyond the functionality categories provide for Wikipedia so having categories as WD items is unnecessary (with the exception of categories used essentially as properties, which probably should be implemented in WD as properties). Basically I am agreeing with you, just elaborating my own viewpoint :) [[User:Silver hr|Silver hr]] ([[User talk:Silver hr|talk]]) 13:49, 14 March 2013 (UTC)\n\n::::The main problem is that WikiData intruded the interwiki system of Wikipedias and Commons but remains halfway. The new system of interwikis disrupted the previous system and some of its functionalities but did not adopt the liability to substitute it complettely and full-blown. Btw., the problem of connection between Commons and Wikipedias (and between articles and corresponding categories) is overripe and is not so difficult to solving. There is no reason to further procrastination. I understand that initiators of WikiData come mainly from fans of infoboxes and infoboxed articles and are not very familiar with categorization and Commons. That should be compensated now. --[[User:\u0160J\u016f|\u0160J\u016f]] ([[User talk:\u0160J\u016f|talk]]) 21:00, 16 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nIt will take some time to develop the software and merge items, but I agree with the proposal. --[[User:NaBUru38|NaBUru38]] ([[User talk:NaBUru38|talk]]) 20:12, 19 March 2013 (UTC)\n\n:I don't think this is possible without significant changes in Wikidata. This would mean that an item can have two links to the same project (but in separate namespaces). This may break a lot of things in the software. Additionally, I think the current system is coherent enough: [[Q36433]] is about the city named Porto, while [[Q1366]] is about the Wikipedia category of articles related to Porto. If the interlanguage links would be provided in a different way, Wikidata would not need an item about a Wikipedia category, but since [[:Wikidata:Requests_for_comment/Inclusion_of_non-article_pages|a RfC]] established that we want the categories on Wikidata, it's clear that they should be separate from the articles. [[User:Rsocol|Rsocol]] ([[User talk:Rsocol|talk]]) 05:28, 30 March 2013 (UTC)\n\n::[[Q36433]] is about the city named Porto as an ''item'' \u2013 not about the Wikipedia ''articles'' about Porto.

The substantial relation between Wikipedia articles, Wikipedia categories and their items (as well as the relation between Wikipedia articles and Commons categories) should had be thought out thoroughly before the phase 1 of WikiData was started.

Regrettably, the WD project was started in very immature and ill-considered condition. --[[User:\u0160J\u016f|\u0160J\u016f]] ([[User talk:\u0160J\u016f|talk]]) 14:35, 31 March 2013 (UTC)\n:::{{Oppose}} as Rsocol above.

Also they cannot remember the information behind the value of the property.

[[User:Silver hr|Silver hr]] ([[User talk:Silver hr|talk]]) 02:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC)\n: That's the point: right now it is impossible to add an item for an editor or author without a link to a wikipedia article (I tried but bots and admins are working very fast to delete item without sitelink) or we have to create new properties based on string datatype for these two properties. [[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|talk]]) 02:19, 25 March 2013 (UTC)\n::An alternative to string would be a multilanguage-string. It would allow us to translate the name of an author. You have the same kind of problems with mayors in smaller cities for example. Most of them will never have an article on any wp. Some arguments has been said, that it will be worth a lot to identify XY as a mayor i Z city, that XY also has written a book, won a gold medal in some sport. I'm not so sure if that is that easy. I have already large problems separating items with identical labels. On svwp, we recently identified a gold-medalist from one of the first modern olympics, as identical as a politican some decades later.

[[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 16:17, 8 May 2013 (UTC)\n:: Just think to the data user in wikipedia: with one property you can recover the data value using the code <nowiki>{{#property:p169}}</nowiki> but if you have 2 properties (one string and one item property) you will need to test each property, something like <nowiki>{{if|#property:p169|#property:p170}}</nowiki>.

Why wouldn't there be an item about something that's connected to a notable item? We're not going to run out of hard drive space. As for the problem of search pollution (where you could get a huge number of probably irrelevant results in your search), there is a technical solution. First, the result ordering can take into consideration the number of statements in an item, which would result in obscure items with few statements being at the bottom of the list. Second, Wikidata's interface is still unfriendly to the general-purpose user. Searching in particular would benefit greatly from being able to specify, sort and filter according to the class of an item, and other properties as well.

At moment all votes are against tagging a software with the license type at all, see [[Wikidata:Property_proposal/Creative_work#License_type|here]]. It doesn't matter if we tag this in an own property or as value of 'is a instance of'. The type can be retrieved from the license itself. All we need is the right query command, which we have to use for the infoboxes (software --> query license --> query license type). However, you can take your original question and rewrite it, how we should label the type of a license (not a software itself).

[[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 10:19, 1 June 2013 (UTC)\n::: I don't see how this is a decision making fact. It might as well not be original research. Plus there is a lot of proprietary licence for example, often one (or several) by software, so the ''licence'' property might be useless in a lot of situation. We could for example have one item by licence, and a set of properties to describe a licence, but it is a lot of work, which could be checked by reading and citing the licence. But choosing which property could be tricky. In my opinion a generic ''licence type'' property with a set of well established type is a much more pratical solution. There exists a lot of classification already done, such as freeware, shareware, free software, ... which can be checked out one way or another.

I'm opening this RfC in order to clarify the situation. Anyway as Legoktm wrote in the previous discussion common sense is probably the solution, simply bureaucrats should be allowed to delete (or suppress) redirects and even hide some logs, they are supposed to be trusted enough to avoid any risk of overuse. --[[User:Vituzzu|Vituzzu]] ([[User talk:Vituzzu|talk]]) 22:20, 13 April 2013 (UTC)\n\n* No, it's the other way around. The previous RfC didn't contain any substantial arguments in favour. I asked where the point in such a policy is and until now nobody has explained it to me. I see exactly 0 arguments for implementing RTV to the bureaucrat policy in the RfC (just \"support, it is standard\" votes). Regardless of that, I don't see the point in making RTV a ''policy''. Using common sense (which is a Wikidata guideline) is absolutely sufficient, in my eyes. Every user can leave the project at any time. Nobody is forced to contribute. Furthermore, any user can request account renaming, regardless whether he wants to vanish or not.

We would need consensus to do this part. The redirects could either way be deleted soon (or immediately) after, especially if it isn't really linked to (apart from in signatures etc.). I planned to go through, closing different sections of the RfC with obvious consensus (and leave the ones without consensus open), but at the time I considered it I thought it might have been a little too soon after it started, and when I went back to do it it had already been closed. <b><span style=\"border:2px solid;font-variant:small-caps\">[[User:Hazard-SJ|<span style=\"background:#00008B;color:#FFF\">&nbsp;Hazard-SJ&nbsp;</span>]][[User talk:Hazard-SJ|<span style=\"color:#00008B;background:red\">&nbsp;\u2708&nbsp;</span>]]</span></b> 02:29, 14 April 2013 (UTC)\n* We need to formulate exactly the proposal first (note that whereas it would be indeed more familiar to en.wp users it might be less familiar to users from other projects: For instance, last time I checked it did not exist on ru.wp), and we need to give our opinions not just on the general issue (which is kind of trivial, since nobody could prevent me from stopping using one account and starting using another one), but on the implementation - how to contact the crats, how many times can the same user vanish, indeed the hiding issues etc.--[[User:Ymblanter|Ymblanter]] ([[User talk:Ymblanter|talk]]) 09:01, 14 April 2013 (UTC)\n** I agree. <b><span style=\"border:2px solid;font-variant:small-caps\">[[User:Hazard-SJ|<span style=\"background:#00008B;color:#FFF\">&nbsp;Hazard-SJ&nbsp;</span>]][[User talk:Hazard-SJ|<span style=\"color:#00008B;background:red\">&nbsp;\u2708&nbsp;</span>]]</span></b> 02:01, 16 April 2013 (UTC)\n* I oppose bringing right to vanish to this project, period. If someone has a life-threatening/life-critical reason to need to vanish, they can take it up with the WMF and have a global vanish. RTV is frequently abused on other projects, sometimes deliberately and maliciously, and I can think of no reason that a local policy would be needed.

Like Vogone said, per WD:UCS a user can just request a rename and go inactive if they want to. [[User:Ajraddatz|Ajraddatz]] <small>([[User Talk:Ajraddatz|Talk]])</small> 12:24, 19 April 2013 (UTC)\n* I support adding a right to vanish. While yes, UCS says people can just go inactive if they so desire, RTV is more than that. RTV is basically the closest to account deletion we have. It is removing someone's username from their contributions, essentially. This is important to codify as a right that the user has, so that users interested in vanishing are not subject to possible obstructionism (\"oppose, does the user REALLY need to vanish?\"), and so their exercising that right is not hampered by reluctance to encounter such obstructionism (whether real or simply feared). \u2014[[User:Scott5114|Scott5114]][[User_talk:Scott5114|\u2197]] <span style=\"font-size:75%\">[[Special:Contributions/Scott5114|[EXACT CHANGE ONLY]]]</span> 20:24, 22 April 2013 (UTC)\n** Again the question: what ''is'' RTV?

With this model the only way to anchor the reference somewhere is to have a statement in an item which comes from this source. With other models you don't need a statement, you can reference the item as a whole. It is not exactly what Wikipedia does (there are anchors for each sentence), but it comes closer to represent the relationships and it could be fine-tuned in the future.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|talk]]) 11:39, 17 April 2013 (UTC)\n::::Why would you want to represent a wikipedia reference in Wikidata?

However, I would like add that the source item should be a particular manifestation, and not just the work. Different editions of the same book can be vastly different in number of pages, chapters, authors etc. It's not even inconceivable that different editions of the same book hold contradictory statements, due to new discoveries or the authors simply changing their minds. See for example [http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/progwineditions.html Programming Windows]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=uq9QAAAAMAAJ first edition] and [http://books.google.com/books?id=giW4IIY_eMoC fifth edition].

These concerns are:\n*The self-referencing problem: If there is no difference between items used as \"regular items\" and items used as \"source items\", wouldn't it be paradoxical that the same item is used both as a statement holder and as item source for those claims?\n:* I do not see what is wrong with this. Often, the best available source of metadata for a book is the book itself. --[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|talk]]) 05:35, 21 April 2013 (UTC)\n*The notability problem: if the existence of a source justifies the existence of a regular item, it might be difficult to create useful notability rules ([[WD:N]]).\n*The splitting problem: an item starts as a work-manifestation mix, and contains information about only one of several manifestations. This item is used as a \"source item\". Later on, information held by the \"source item\" is split and now there is an item holding the work information, and several items for each manifestation. The \"claim source\" is still pointing to the original \"source item\", but the manifestation information is no longer there. \nThe last one might be quite rare, and it can be solved with a clever frontend, a splitting tool, or such instances can be queried. The second it is a bit tricky... maybe requiring \"instance of: source\" with a proof-of-existence link for items that have no wikipedia links? And I wouldn't allow to use an item as a self-reference.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|talk]]) 22:41, 20 April 2013 (UTC)\n: But then again you might need to introduce a book twice, once as a source item and once as a normal item. And they have the same metadata. Where would authors be? Places of publication? etc. I don't see the advantage of having distinct itemspaces. --[[User:Denny|Denny]] ([[User talk:Denny|talk]]) 10:56, 22 April 2013 (UTC)\n:: I see your point, Denny. Ideally all version/edition info should be in the same item, but then we have no way of selecting one version or another (there are no sub-item identifiers) and the list could grow too long.

Maybe the possible problems are not that important, there will be not that many items that need \"versioning\". --[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|talk]]) 13:31, 22 April 2013 (UTC)\n::: Another possible option could be that an item represents both the work and the first edition/version.

The three possible functions of an item using this model would be:\n*Item (Open Annotation \"body\", Wikidata: \"instance of: item\"). It would be items as we know them now (1 wikipedia article = 1 item)\n*Reference (Open Annotation \"annotation\", Wikidata: \"instance of: reference\"). They would represent references as used in Wikipedia, and also references to specify statement sources.\n*Source (Open Annotation \"target\", Wikidata: \"instance of: source\").

[[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|talk]]) 08:02, 17 April 2013 (UTC)\n::A source is the container of the data being referenced, and the reference is the pointer to a specific part of that body of data. A source could be ''Coyne, Jerry A.; Barton, Turelli (1997). \"Perspective: A Critique of Sewall Wright's Shifting Balance Theory of Evolution\"'', which could be referenced by 2 different Wikipedia articles. The first reference could point to one page and have a quote, the second reference could point to another different page and have an annotation about it. Or a source could be a video interview, and there could be references to specific parts of the video.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|talk]]) 11:16, 17 April 2013 (UTC)\n* {{comment}} Item's are so fundamental in Wikidata that I wonder how we could avoid creating a lot more of them than there is Wikipedia article. If we choose this solution this will just be one more example of this reality, si I don't really think it is a real problem. Maintenance of these are more to be thought exactly as an article is maintained rigth now : a article as a set of references and sources, and managing them is a part of the editor work in Wikidata. What is to be done is not to avoid creating items not so that wikidataans will not have to maintain them, it is to help Wikipedians managing sourcing and references as easily as possible. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]]) 12:13, 17 April 2013 (UTC)\n* Why would we make an item for every single reference, or even source? I think that's way overkill. --[[User:Denny|Denny]] ([[User talk:Denny|talk]]) 14:11, 18 April 2013 (UTC)\n*: @Denny. Because of reuse of the reference. One book (as a manifestation of a work) can be used thousand times as reference. Have it as an item avoid to add each time some data of the book. I will a example from my field: CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics contains thousands physical data. By creating an item for a specific edition with all data (title, editor, edition, place of publication, publisher, date of publication, ISBN) I can avoid to add these informations in the source section for each claim: a link to the item and one property for the page and done. And this will avoid some edition errors you can have if you have to edit manually. Here you can guess this solution will save ressources if the reference will be used one thousand times. The problem is now to decide if we can do that for all references used in wikidata. In order to have an homogenous structure we should especially for the templates which are responsible to extract data and to format them in the client side. [[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|talk]]) 15:07, 18 April 2013 (UTC)\n:::@Snipre: another option for those cases is to have an item for the source and a qualifier stating the page every time we use the source in a statement.

If the use and the interest are both different in sources than in items, then it is advised to convey this difference as clearly as possible.

The whole point of wikidata was to move away from this type of semi-structured data. (2) Qualifiers are meant to qualify a value. Storing the metadata of an edition in the qualifier space, does not qualify the value (in this proposal the value is {number - language code}.

None of the proposed options seems satisfactory for the several reasons exposed above. The option \"with qualifiers\" doesn't represent the exact semantic nature of a FRBR-relationship. On the other hand, the option of having separate items in the current form of Wikidata means that the item creation and maintainability (for users) would mean an extra effort and, while the data would be machine readable, the interface wouldn't efficiently display the information to potential human readers. \nSome brainstorming with Daniel Kinzler et al. lead to the conclusion that in order to support editions as separate items while maintaining the visual clarity of the option \"with qualifiers\" it would require of two developments that seem to be easily reachable and that would benefit the Wikidata community at large:\n#Expandable information for items: meaning that item A used as property inside item B would have an arrow/option to display some properties of item A without visiting its page. The number of displayed properties could be around 5, with a \"show more\" option. \n#Item creation from another item: meaning that the user wouldn't need to interrupt the process of modification of an item to create another one. It will probably be an applet for item creation combined with an entity suggester (for instance when adding an edition it would suggest \"is edition of\" the item currently being displayed).\nWhile the time frame for these features is still unclear, I hope we can move towards it.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|talk]]) 21:23, 28 May 2013 (UTC)\n:*Good ideas, and in line with what I've been saying: we should recognize user interface problems as such and solve them as such, instead of modifying the semantic structure of our data just so that it would display a certain way.

The user interface would be improved at some time in the future so you can edit a referenced item without leaving the page you are on.\n:This will make it easy to refer  to a particular edition in a source but will complicate the wikilinks. Each language wiki with an article about the book will have to decide if they should link to the main wikidata page for the book or to the wikidata page for the translation of the book. If they choose the first option then they get lots of langlinks but the syntax for importing statements from the translated edition(s) wikidata pages is more complicated as the infobox template needs the item number for that page. \n:If they link to the translation then they get very few links (other languages link to the original or to the edition in their language) but the template can probably get the data from the page for the original book automatically via the link to that wikidata item via a 'translated from' property.

With well structured data, the template can be set to do the \"commonly desired\" result unless an editor specifically requests something different.  And on some occasions you ''do'' want to do something different: for instance, you might create a wikisource page on \"The Origin of Species, First Edition\" in which case you want to link to only that edition (and its translations).    [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|talk]]) 01:48, 1 June 2013 (UTC)\n::: I agree with Sj that while being valid concerns, it is more a problem of interface that anything else. In my opinion \"edition items\" shouldn't be used for holding language links unless the wikipedia article refers to a particular edition (rare). However we should rethink the book infobox and be able to link to the main work item and optionally to a \"featured edition\" of that work.

If the foreign language wikipedia page has a site link to the wikidata page for the original book (to get all those other site links) then there is no easy way for the infobox on the foreign language wikipedia page to automatically find the wikidata page for the translation which has this information about the translation. Editors may have to enter the Q number for the local language edition wikidata page by hand in this template only unless the infobox code is clever enough to figure out the language of the wikipedia and then find the {{P|393}} for that language (it better have a qualifier with the {{P|424}}) and follow the link to the wikidata page for that edition to get the extra info.\n::::Citations will also link to a page in a particular edition.

This is not the most important thing (this will be important to clasify sources between them when you have several sources), what is important is to source at least once with a correct source then later you can add better sources. This will a task for task forces to define the best sources for each field: for scientific subjects scientific journals will be necessary or at least wellknow handbooks, for video games I don't expect to find scientific articles, for catch or soccer if we have sport magazines it will be a dream,....

In my opinion we have to indicate in the description you updated all relevant properties: people have to have all information in the same page and we have to avoid link to tables located in a different page. Then I proposed to avoid to link the work item with all its edition items: if each edition item is connected to the work item we don't need the double links. And this will keep the work item as clean as possible. Finally I am wondering if we have to classify these edition items in a specific way in order to distinguish them: this can be helpful for some kind of query to look only in edition items instead in work items. 08:24, 5 June 2013 (UTC)\n: @[[User:Li3939108|<span style=\"font-family:sans-serif;\">\u51e1\u5176</span>]]. In your example {{Q|13414893}} you define the page property, the date of publication and the issue as qualifiers of the scientific journal in which the article is published. I prefer to move these information as property of the article and not as qualifier of the journal because 1) this will be more simple to extract in a template (less sublevels in data query) 2) these properties refer to the article, they are characteristics of the article and not of the journal. Do you have any concern if we propose to list this kind of data in that way ? [[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|talk]]) 08:24, 5 June 2013 (UTC)\n::   On second thoughts, maybe the \"date of publication\" should be a statement rather than a qualifier, because it has its meaning independent of the journal. The volume, issue, and page describe the relation between the journal and the article. I am not sure about the precise meaning of [[:Wikidata:Glossary#Qualifier|qualifier]]. If the qualifiers can be used to describe the relation, I think its better to store these info as qualifiers, but if the qualifiers can only be used to describe some properties of the journal, they should be moved as property of the article.

Then page is a property of the article and not a qualifier of the journal because you can understand that property as the pages of the whole journal or pages of the whole volume/issue of the journal if this is put as qualifier.

This is rare for scientific journals but common for literature magazines( see [[:en:Stephen_King_short_fiction_bibliography]], and I am sure it is true for many Chinese writers). The \"date of Publication\" can be stored as both qualifier and statement to represent \"specific date of publication for that magazine\" and \"original date of publication for that article\" . It is better to treat magazine article in the same way although literature articles are rarely  used as sources . I changed {{Q|13414893}} for comparing with {{Q|13416617}}.

Take for example {{Q|2115648}} a german standard medicine book. It has currently 264 editions. Should I file a bot request to create them all because I think that this will be used often as a reference? The information about the edition can better stored in the sources section as part of the source.\n:: Or maybe we will have a Harry Potter task force. The task force creates items for all persons and places and wants to source them well. Because they are multilingual they will source all statements with book editions they have thereself, there will be items for books in different languages and also items in the same language. But all the books have (normally) the same content.\n:: Maybe we can also add informations like pictures of the cover about different editions to the main item and use qualifiers to distinguish them.\n:Scientific, newspaper or magazine article:\n::Mainly the same things as in the books section.\n:Trusted database:\n::Very many trusted databases are online like LCCN or GND, but they are different to a webpage, because that I propose to use a different sourcing layout. I agree with the authors of this proposed guideline, that the {{P|585}} is important for databases. But instead of using a single \"databse ID property\" I propose to use the existing special properties for databases like {{P|244}} or {{P|214}} and extend them to the list of used, trusted databases. The {{P|248}} is not needed anymore.\n:Some general comments:\n::If we have so many different items sources it makes search queries more complex. If we want to get all places where book is used as a reference, we need to search first for all editions of the book and then we have to search for all usings as source. That means we need at minimum two more complex queries, otherwise we would only need one easy query.\n::Today most of the bots don't add \"reliable\" sources to their edits. We can't just stop them all, this would kill Wikidata.\n::Because Wikidata is a multilingual project we need to translate labels to multiple languages. If we have less items they have often Wikipedia articles, so the Wikipedia article title can be automatically used for the label in the articles language. Descriptions can't be autocreated so often, so they need to be updated manually, this means it makes a big difference between 1 description for each language or many descriptions for each language to describe a book or an article.\n::Please don't forget that also Wikipedia started with stubs and not with feautured articles. Wikidata should work the same way, first start with not so well sourced \"stubs\" and then extend them to \"feautured items\", otherway arround it don't work like the Nupedia project showed us.\nWaiting for your ideas and comments --[[User:Pyfisch|Pyfisch]] ([[User talk:Pyfisch|talk]]) 14:19, 10 June 2013 (UTC)\n:Note: The system of creating an item for single editions was rejected by a 2/3 majority of the votes, this point have to be changed in the proposed guideline.

Then think of the data extraction in wikipedia: how do you want to label the source with only an ID and date ? There is no possibility to extract from the database ID property the corresponding database in which it is used. Just have a look once at a wikipedia page using database references: you need the name of the database and if possible a link to the webpage, if the data is online a link to the webpage containing the data and the access date.

We could actually get rid of all the database specific properties if we use \"stated in\" = \"name of database\" with another property \"ID in database\" = \"1234\" and all we need to create a link would be the basic url that could be stored with the item.

It will be impossible to tell human newbies that although 99.999% of the statements they see are unsourced, we do recommend that ordinary humans use sources properly (and probably also recommend that they source the bots' statements!). We'll also get blasted by local Wikipedias who have expressed concerns about using Wikidata's data if it's improperly sourced. I get the feeling that bot proponents believe that bots shouldn't be bothered with sources because it will prevent Wikidata from adding tons of statements. But on the contrary, ''because'' bots are able to flood Wikidata with millions of statements in a very short time, we need them to do things right. And it's not impossible. It's slower and it's less convenient for bot operators because you need a separate bot for every reliable database that can be harvested for data.

This is consistent with how other bibliographic databases work (e.g. most scientific publishers using [[wikipedia:digital object identifier|digital object identifier]]s). Managing the large number of items then boils down to designing an appropriate user-interface that can e.g. automatically embed sub-items into their parent(s). This is not a trivial task, but subdividing \"atomic\" items into smaller parts, seems much more problematic: e.g. I don't see how I would easily indicate a particular printing of a book comes with a specific set of OCLC, publisher, publication data, ''etcetera'', by using qualifiers instead of actually splitting the item. &mdash;''[[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud]]'' 23:42, 24 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n===Oppose===\n* From a pure usability standpoint, I am '''extremely''' concerned about adding an item for any and every source used (at least, books anyway), and I'm not sure those items would fill the need set out in [[WD:N]] for \"structural\" purposes (which itself is meant for items which connect items to other items as in an \"unnotable [in the en.Wikipedia sense] father linking a son and a grandfather). --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|talk]]) 22:32, 17 June 2013 (UTC)\n*: I would tend to support a new namespace for sourcing data (S-namespace), one which is not necessarily confined by many of the rules of types and such that the Q-namespace has about it. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|talk]]) 02:26, 22 June 2013 (UTC)\n* {{weak oppose}} I agree with Izno, if the above guidelines are continued making entity for every book plus editions, articles, etc would clutter the wikidata entity. I know that this is the only available technology but couldn't a sister project of wikimedia like wikisource create the repository of books/article/web instead? Although the sister project wikisource can only use out of copyright and public domain source, how about creating a similar sister project like wiki-spiplet? I just want to separate the wikidata claim from the source data to avoid cluttering wikidata --[[User:Napoleon.tan|Napoleon.tan]] ([[User talk:Napoleon.tan|talk]]) 23:30, 17 June 2013 (UTC)\n:*We already had the discussion about using a different namespace for sources and there was some opposition. The reason is that book data is used by infoboxes too, so it would be redundant or confusing. About using a different repository for storing source information I give you my {{s}} (see also my message about [//lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikidata-l/2013-June/002335.html a possible ecosystem of wikidata repositories]), however given the small size of the community and the amount of work to be done, I don't see it happening at this point. I must say that by having the sources as separate items it should be easy to do it in the future if there is the need.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|talk]]) 02:00, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n:* Values can't be separated from their sources, that's a key point for a reliable database so the use of another database for storing sources is not a good idea. The unique good solution would be the creation of a specific namespace S (after Q for items and P for properties) in order to differentiate the type of data. This was not supported and the above solution is the only one offering a good reusability of a source. If we want to distinguish in a better way the data item from the source item, we can define a new property or a new GND type to identify the sources. Then the item solution is not an issue if contributors use mainly reference books and not web or newspaper references: by selecting high data density documents the number of items is reduced. Task forces are an important factor to organize the data import, to select and to rank the best sources. [[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|talk]]) 07:42, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n* {{weak oppose}} I think we don't need an item for each Journal Article it Would be good if Sources could also have qualifiers then it would be sufficient to use The journal as source and all the other Information like Author, and DOI as qualifiers for that.--[[User:Saehrimnir|Saehrimnir]] ([[User talk:Saehrimnir|talk]]) 16:08, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n* {{Oppose}} Absolutely against having an item for every journal article, against having one item per edition. These two point should be simplified further. --[[User:Sannita|Sannita]] - <small>''[[User talk:Sannita|not just another it.wiki sysop]]''</small> 15:12, 20 June 2013 (UTC)\n*: More simplification means no reusability of sources: without item we have to add all source parameter under the claim manually. This is the unique possibility if item option is not chosen. [[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|talk]]) 16:35, 20 June 2013 (UTC\n*::To make sources reusable I propose to add all informations about editions to the main item using qualifiers. Example: {{P|291}} \u2192 {{Q|90}} (Edition 1) --[[User:Pyfisch|Pyfisch]] ([[User talk:Pyfisch|talk]]) 15:14, 21 June 2013 (UTC)\n*::: But you will need to add the publisher as qualifier because the edition is not enough for some books which were published several times by different publishers. Then you have to do that for different properties: place of publication, date of publication, editor, ISBN, publisher... And this will save a certain number of items but what do you propose for articles, reports, medias ? Just to give you an idea, I am using right now one scientific article to source more than 300 statements so I am really interested by your solution for that case. [[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|talk]]) 19:19, 21 June 2013 (UTC)\n*::::and when you have done all that and entered all the edition data as qualifiers you will find there is no way to link to that edition from a source because you can only link to items. This is why I switched from supporting 'each edition a statement' to 'editions used in sources are items; other editions are statements in the original book page' - as is shown in the discussion at the top of the page. --[[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 22:17, 21 June 2013 (UTC)\n*:::::@Snipre: First of all, I'm really sorry for pointing this problems only now, but in the last month I literally worked my *** out - just think that in the last week I've worked up to 14 hours a day - so I ''really'' haven't got the time to say anything in this RfC. I don't like to be the guy who doesn't participate to a discussion and later comes and make disruptive comments, but this time I had no choice.\n*:::::That said, I still don't think that having one item for every edition of a book is a good idea. Pyfisch made an example about [[Q2115648|this book]], that has currently two hundreds and sixty-four editions... do you really think we can afford to make two hundreds and sixty-four items, one per edition? I think this is just barely manageable. In all my years, I've also quoted some informations from very well known novels, like The Count of Monte Cristo. Just imagine how many editions and translations are out there of this novel... And for the sake of sanity, I'm not even going to start talking about single articles.\n*:::::I don't see the point in having a separate item, and I don't see a clear consensus about that - but probably I'm missing something of this ''very'' long discussion. So if someone, please, may explain to me why we should adopt this solution, I'd be more than delighted to hear, and possibly we can discuss a new solution.--[[User:Sannita|Sannita]] - <small>''[[User talk:Sannita|not just another it.wiki sysop]]''</small> 12:07, 22 June 2013 (UTC)\n*::::::Hmm\u2026 Even though some books have up to several hundreds editions, only a few of them are likely to be used. The main idea behind this system of references would be to create new editions ''as long as they are needed'' : statistically, the community is not wide enough to make current use of more than several editions per work. [[User:Alexander Doria|Alexander Doria]] ([[User talk:Alexander Doria|talk]]) 12:30, 22 June 2013 (UTC)\n*::::::@[[User:Sannita|Sannita]]. I don't want to redo the discussion of the last 2 months but there are only 3 possibilities for sourcing: 1) all source parameters in the source section of the statement but this means no reusability, 2) items for work and editions, full reusability but medium complexity to manage the system, 3) 1 item with all editions data, simple simple for wikidata but very complex system to extract source data in wikipedia when displaying source information. Then as said the idea for edition and articles is to allow only reference used as sources in statements. [[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|talk]]) 01:59, 23 June 2013 (UTC)\n*::::::: I missed the part about sources only for Wikidata. I think it would be a mistake to strictly enforce this policy as it would not allow to use Wikidata to source Wikipedia articles, which could be a great improvement and a chance for sources on wikipedia. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]]) 11:22, 23 June 2013 (UTC)\n*:::::@Snipre: You are aware of big items?! If only these editions are set which are needed for sources the items are not growing so big, so we will not reach 300 statements per item normally. And if we have more statements, this is the more litte problem than the problems with extra items: how to translate all edition labels and descs without more human work? And how to find out the correct item from many edition items? Note: I miss rules about edition naming. --[[User:Pyfisch|Pyfisch]] ([[User talk:Pyfisch|talk]]) 16:27, 24 June 2013 (UTC)\n*{{strong oppose}} per Sannita and Izno.

One simple advice to make the distinction a bit clearer would be to add the edition number in the label, [//www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q13416128&diff=prev&oldid=51383707 like here]. \n*::The edition info for the first edition is included on the page for the original book. only subsequent editions (if they are used as sources) need additional pages. --[[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 22:25, 21 June 2013 (UTC)\n*:::So this means [[Q13416128]] is incorrect ?

I do not think it makes sense to have a different property for \"depicted in the image\" and \"depicted in the text\", even though that may make the label a bit awkward. And sometimes, a document has both text and images. So I really think {{P|180}} is appropriate. That said it make make sense to merge it with P301, though it avoids to mix up Wikipedia-maintenance with normal content. --[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|talk]]) 07:21, 23 June 2013 (UTC)\n*:::You were right, the word \"category\" was removed from P301 (fixed), that is why I was confused about its potential use.

Given the long time that publishing often takes, it may sometimes make sense to use them. For instance, [[:en:Age of the universe]] makes use of the [http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5225 third draft of a paper], and I suppose that they do so because it is more up to date and accurate than anything officially published. In this case, one solution could be to just provide the Arxiv number, but it would not provide much info. --[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|talk]]) 18:54, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n*: An unpublished article in a peer review journal or an unpublished book can't be used as source: the information and data can change until the final approval leading to unconsistancy data.

Pseudonymous books are but one example of the possible complexities. The source for a author being associated with the book is the cataloging record by a national authority, not the book itself. (The most serious difficulty is  the same one that it has been since the 19th century, the real or nominal authorship of a book by an organization ,or , more recently, but a collective. There remains no simple solution for this--there are multiple levels of \"authorship\".   To make clear that the term authorship is ambiguous, the term used in modern cataloging codes is the very clearly multi-meaning term:  \"Responsibility\"[[User:DGG|DGG]] ([[User talk:DGG|talk]]) 03:30, 22 June 2013 (UTC)\n*:This kind of discussion is better in the talk page of the property author.

The best would be to move the guidelines to [[help:sources]], translate them there, and also write a blog post explaining the reasons for this model, what can you do with it, addressing concerns, etc. Most of the opposition I am seeing is because of interface issues, which can be solved by having a gadget to create/link all necessary items at once, and \"too many items\", which could be solved by having \"S\" entities...

There doesn't seem to be disagreement around the idea that most statements should be sourced and no disagreement on how to handle websites, technical documentation and trusted databases.

It does not make much sense to have items here for every chapter in a book. The interwiki on WS works differently than on WP, it does not fit the system with items here. An example is \"V\u00e5rt land\", the anthem of Finland. The original text is in Swedish, made by \"Johan Ludvig Runeberg\". Such information can be added to an item. But the corresponding pages in fi.wikisource and en.wikisource do not have \"Runeberg\" as an author. And fi.wikisource has four pages, and I would like to have interwiki to them all from svwikisource. Therefor you need sitelink-specific claims, and you need to have more than one sitelink to fiwikisource in one item. This is not possible yet, and I doubt that it will ever be. Another solution would be to have one item for each text with never more than one sitelink. But what need is there for Wikidata then? It would be like having one single item for every single article on all wikipedias. Adding Author-ns sounds good, but how will it look like on Wikipedia and Wikisource. Will there on the page of enwp:Charles Darwin be a link to all Wikisources that has texts of Darwin? And on Wikisouce, will there be a link to all wp-pages about Darwin? I doubt that it will make any sense. And if we choose to have only one link from WP in a WS-page, which page will be choosen? There is an article about the book [//sv.wikisource.org/wiki/Amtmannens_d%C3%B6ttrar Amtmannens d\u00f6ttrar] on nowp.

This also implies creating as many items as necessary, even if it's for every single word in every single language. Items are free. We're not going to run out of hard drive space, and any user-interface issues resulting from a lot of items should be solved by good user interface design, not by restricting the data.

It appears to me to have multiple facets, so I will attempt to summarize each and then give my assessment on what should be done.\n*:* Supporters (and the majority by headcount of 7-4, not including Jasper or DangSunM) for admin-only claim that users with the CheckUser right but without the administrator rights can be crippled in his work, while supporters for all users claim that the CU package does not need the administrator package. Both sides evidence wikis with CU programs of this sort, though only the admin-only supporters make the positive claim that there exist wikis where CUs are crippled due to this. The users-only supporters do not attempt to negate that claim&mdash;which does not make the claim \"there are wikis where CUs do not have administrator rights and which function normally with respect to CheckUser\" less true, only that such a claim went unmade.\n*:* There is an undercurrent, among both supporters of admin-only and supporters of all users, that adminship is easy to attain on this wiki. I find this argument unfortunate, as there may come a future where this is not the case. Speaking personally, I have noticed the opposite beginning to be the case.\n*:* There is a second undercurrent, seemingly shared by three supporters of admins-only and one supporter of all users that blockers acting under the authority of a CheckUser should not make a block until another CU or admin has verified that block. This seems to tear a (small) hole in the argument that \"a CU should be able to block by himself\", in that he might not be able to block for himself even if he could, following this line of reasoning... As an aside, it is odd that one of the primary supporters of admins-only made comments to the effect of both.\n*: Given this odd mixture of points, I am closing this as '''no consensus''', without prejudice to ''either option''. I realize this may result in a \"default\" of all users, as the global policy makes no other comment than that a user be of the age of majority, be 18 years of age, have 25 votes in support (now-superseded by local policy), and be identified to the WMF. Users wishing to create local policy on this should show evidence&mdash;either through a second, more-widely-advertised RFC specifically on this subject, or through multiple CheckUser elections&mdash;that the community at large desires candidate of a particular type. It seems likely to me that there is a compromise position between the two offered here, and such positions may be wise to pursue.\n*: --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|talk]]) 23:28, 11 August 2013 (UTC)\n\n----\n'''Note:''' This is ''only'' in regards to the policy.

Valid reasons, according to current CheckUser practice, would be blocking long-time editors because they used the same IP as another editor. Regardless of disruption that editor. Regardless of a general Western European cultural requirement to punish ''after'' discussion, not before, and a general Northern European cultural requirement to be judged by the community, instead of the man of the hour. There is no ''requirement'' (only an assumption) for balance or reasonableness based on an ''editor's'', you know, ''edits''. Same IP can (which means will) mean same editor, 10000 solid edits or not. Under the proposed policy, the community cannot overrule a CU because a blocked editor has not been disruptive. Un-block Jimbo without \"permission from a CheckUser\", get de-sysop'd. I can already hear your counterarguments that that is unlikely to happen, that Supreme Court review (the highest appeal authority) will make LAPD (beat cop) abuse unlikely to go unremedied. Only ignorance can sustain such as assertion, and this ignorance is here and now being exploited. This discussion should stand as an example to prove Hitler was indeed not evil, but merely reacting to his circumstances with what his subculture viewed as reasonable and acceptable.

If anything, I think this comment is nothing but expressing outrage at your being mistakenly blocked by a CheckUser on the English Wikipedia, which happens very rarely. CheckUsers are elected by the community and can be removed by the community, so they remain accountable. Given that you have made almost no edits to Wikidata except to this RfC, I really question whether you're interested in pushing your own grief about that block or whether you're genuinely interested in helping build a knowledgebase.--[[User:Jasper Deng|Jasper Deng]] ([[User talk:Jasper Deng|talk]]) 01:12, 3 August 2013 (UTC)\n#::@[[User:Int21h|Int21h]]: I am feeling very inclined as to follow one of these paths: i) Struck your vote, as it doesn't really ''assess'' what we are discussing here; or ii) ask you to ''put up or shut up'' with these claims.

(I didn't even know we were voting!) Is that how Wikidata deals with dissenting comments? And if you are suggesting I censor myself (\"put up or shut up\") on requests for comments involving a serious part of project operations, because you don't agree with me.. No. At least not on your say so. What is your excuse for adverse administrative action, that my espoused view does not \"assess what we are discussing\"? This is a rather good, basic example of what lengths people will go to rationalize their desire to hurt people, and what will inevitably happen with CheckUsers. That's 3 of the 14 editors, and I imagine it would have climbed to a majority if I would not have responded quickly enough. (It may yet, though I would like to let it, to prove a point about what will happen to those less able to counter such accusations and, well, ''mock them''.) It is described in perhaps one the best known of the ancient fables, [[w:The Wolf and the Lamb|The Wolf and the Lamb]]. The Wikipedia [[w:Group_conflict#Intragroup_conflict_.28infighting.29|group conflict]] article on \"task conflict\" seems rather on point here as well: \"However, people who disagree with the group do so at their own peril, even when their position is reasonable. Dissenters often receive a high level of animosity from other group members, are less well-liked, assigned low-status tasks, and are sometimes ostracized.\" ''Eerie''. Add in a lack of community judgement and \"secret evidence\" and what do you get? This. You get this proposal.

The point of this section is to assess whether the current written draft is fit to be updated to policy with the amendments voted below. Your concerns about how CUs will behave are unfounded, and that's why I said put up or shut up. Why? Because you are not providing any evidence that such behaviour actually exists, and therefore all your claims are, ''de facto'', unsupported by any evidence whatsoever and false. I don't really care about the English Wikipedia, since ''this'' is Wikidata and we make our own rules. Oh, and the most important of these rules is: The problems of the English Wikipedia '''stay''' at the English Wikipedia; don't bring them here. \u2014 [[User:Hahc21|<font color=\"#333333\">'''\u039b\u03a7\u03a3'''</font>]][[User_talk:Hahc21|<font color=\"#336699\">'''<sup>21</sup>'''</font>]] 03:20, 4 August 2013 (UTC)\n#:::::This was a response to the assertion that I am acting in bad faith, and against this notion of a vote strike. It was not to \"provide evidence\". My evidence, and I again thought this was self-evident, is all the administrator abuse on all projects that has happened before Wikidata came into existence. It is ''de facto'' relevant given Wikidata's age and the permanence of this policy, which will affect all editors, not just those that have editing up until now. And as if not providing evidence for a point of view is a reason to force everyone ignore it or censor it.. (Then how many of these other \"votes\" would be invalid?) All this is extraneous to my original comment. This \"wall of text\" was brought on by the responses, as I was requested to respond. Sometimes it gets long. Next time maybe bring the replies to my comment somewhere else?\n#:::::As for the notion that somehow CU abuse is going to limited to the English Wikipedia, that is the epitome of ignorance. To ignore. That's like saying administrator abuse will be limited to the English Wikipedia. That argument against my \"non-evidence\" fails as absurd, not to say wishful thinking. Its an excuse. The fact is it has happened, and you are making one excuse after another to ignore it, instead of accepting my argument as a valid argument to be addressed on its merits. You appear to be stopping at nothing to discount its applicability to the conversation at hand so you don't have to address the merits. (Although I admit, even saying its not an issue on Wikidata because it happened on Wikipedia is somewhat addressing the merits, just in a dismissive, and quite frankly ''ignorant'', as in ignoring something, way. And its the first time anyone has addressed the merits of my argument, rather than just completely dismiss it implicitly and call for a vote strike.) [[User:Int21h|Int21h]] ([[User talk:Int21h|talk]]) 19:03, 4 August 2013 (UTC)\n#::::::Again, and I think it is ignorance from your part to think so, CU abuse has only happened in the English Wikipedia, prominently. Same with sysop abuse, mostly. I am an administrator at three Wikimedia projects, buraucrat in two, and I constantly edit at approximately ten projects. So far, in almost six years of career, I've only seen abuse at the English Wikipedia. Here, in Wikidata, which is what matters, such abuse is not going to happen, and has yet to happen.\n#::::::Why? Well, because we have [[Wikidata:Requests_for_permissions/Removal|a rather easy procedure]] to desysop any administrator that starts misbehaving under our current standards, and we won't hesitate on doing so if needed. Therefore, no admin would ever become abusive without facing the consequences. And not from ArbCom, but from the community itself. Same with CheckUser. You know, I understand where you come from. I know what happened to you over the English Wikipedia, and I can assure you that I won't let those mistakes to happen here. \u2014 [[User:Hahc21|<font color=\"#333333\">'''\u039b\u03a7\u03a3'''</font>]][[User_talk:Hahc21|<font color=\"#336699\">'''<sup>21</sup>'''</font>]] 01:00, 5 August 2013 (UTC)\n#:::::::Well, thank you for actually addressing the merits of my argument. The excuse you just gave to vote strike is the ''exact'' type of excuse a CheckUser will give to abuse his privilege. You are here and now calling for an adverse administrative action, and you see absolutely nothing wrong with it. Your action in response to my comment could have very easily been \"check his IP to see if he's a banned user\" instead of \"vote strike\" if you were a CU, all because of what? How many reasons have you put forth? Not assessing, ranting, etc. You see absolutely nothing wrong with your desire to punish me. Nothing. And the 2 other CheckUsers, lets just say for the argument they were John F. Lewis and Jasper Deng, would also see nothing wrong with it. ''No one would ever know''. There is reason (in your opinion) to censor my comment here, yet do you assert you would not have CheckUser investigated me? I mean, it ''really'' doesn't get any more obvious than this vis-a-vis the excuses people will give to start a CheckUser investigation.. It would be laughable if it weren't such a serious issue that has to be addressed.\n#:::::::And Wikidata is what? 8 months old? That's 2 months older than my GeoSPARQL article! The next largest project behind the English Wikipedia is what? The German Wikipedia with how many users comparably? A fraction? And that somehow means they are immune from the English Wikipedia's problems? Yet I would bet that the German Wikipedia has more banned users as a percent of their userbase than any other project, with the French Wikipedia in close second. Yet again, there are many, many who are going to become CheckUsers here, who see absolutely nothing wrong with this. ''That'' is the problem here.\n#:::::::'''In closing, answer me one thing''': is my behavior not reason for a CheckUser investigation, and if not, how are the standards different for that of a vote strike? [[User:Int21h|Int21h]] ([[User talk:Int21h|talk]]) 02:50, 5 August 2013 (UTC)\n#::::::::To answer your question: Your behaviour here is not reason to hold a CheckUser investigation. Actually, now I see what is the problem here: You think that we want to strike your vote because we think that your are a sockpuppet or a sockmaster or whatever. You have misinterpreted my comment: When I said ''strike the vote'', I meant not counting it because your original comment has nothing to do with what we are voting or discussing on ''this'' section. It is a matter of numbers. My intention was never to ''punish'' you, and I personally dislike the use of that word.\n#::::::::Punishment is never beneficial, but your original comment made me think that you weren't here on a productive basis. And I acted preemptively by voicing my thoughts publicly instead of single-handedly striking your vote or blocking you for being \"disruptive\", for example. That's the main difference between Wikidata and the English Wikipedia. We prevent taking unnecessarily painful actions and discuss the matters at hand before performing any action. And any sysop that breaks this rule is dutily admonished.\n#::::::::Now, about the standards: CU investigation is held only when abuse of multiple accounts is suspected. And evidence needs to be offered for that. As a multilingual project, like Commons, our standards for vote-striking are beyond sockpuppetry. We can strike a vote if we reach consensus that it is: i) not focused on what is being discussed, ii) trolling, iii) bad-faith comments, or iv) sockpuppetry or meatpuppetry. Standards vary though. \u2014 [[User:Hahc21|<font color=\"#333333\">'''\u039b\u03a7\u03a3'''</font>]][[User_talk:Hahc21|<font color=\"#336699\">'''<sup>21</sup>'''</font>]] 16:18, 5 August 2013 (UTC)\n#::Well, it is an oversight of mine to not define \"your\" as in \"your ignorance\". (I am always afraid my points, with too much supporting evidence, will be too long, like with the intro for [[w:Freedom of speech by country#United Kingdom|Freedom of speech by country#United Kingdom]] which is actually 2 or 3 sentences. I can get quite technical.) I meant those who have either proposed or advocated this policy. I thought that was obvious. (Many may be ignorant of this fact, but the entire community does not hold your opinion. Or perhaps someone is looking for an excuse to ban/hurt/punish someone?) Neither did I accuse anyone of being \"ignorant\", quite a weasel word mind you, but accused you (again, refer to my clarification, as a generic you) of being \"ingorant of actual CU practice\", which is a considerably qualified form, and it is this ignorance with which I thereafter refer. (Yes, my semantics may be pedantic, but hey, look where we are.) I stand by that assertion, and offer not only my original paragraph as evidence, but to the lack of negative response to the above comment wishing to punish me for my comment. I mean, if its OK to punish someone for a comment on an RfC because of the content which it contains, then why would it magically be not OK for a CheckUser to punish someone for anything similar (\"non-assessment\" or whatever else one can, or cannot, think of)? As for Wikidata, you are correct I have made few (no?) edits. I find it very difficult to edit without an IPBE, and I have even been forced to stop editing Wikisource for the same reason. I wrote the Wikipedia article on [[w:GeoSPARQL|GeoSPARQL]] 6 months or so ago, which was my first real introduction to knowledgebases, if you would like a taste of my related work. (I actually think you ''want'' me to have malicious intent, so you can discount my argument(s) without having to address the merits in any detail, which so far, no one has done. I have only received accusations of malicious intent, which, I argue, is a commonplace response.) As for \"pushing my grief\", yes, I guess you are right, but I believe it is beneficial for people to understand that not only can it happen, but it has happened, it will again, that this is likely, and it will be done for the weakest of excuses (excuses meaning that the real reason is not the given reason, is an invalid reason, or is otherwise unreasonable). In that, I think my comment(s) will help build the project. While it is unfortunate that people will get angry about my comments, I would like to say that I was a naysayer from the very beginning, warning those who would listen of the dangers of what they were proposing.

If one needs an IPBE, it is because they cannot edit, so there will be no IP logs and there will be nothing for the CU to check. I, for example, have no Wikidata edits because it is so darn difficult to edit without an IPBE like I have on Wikipedia, so how would my request be verified? Would I be denied because I was able to edit this for a day? Because that's what this means. Both one's ability to edit, ''and'' one's ability to provide \"[verification of] a need for IP block exemption\", will be made impossible by this policy; or one's ability to edit a few times will forever more deny him the ability to edit. It is a classic unreasonable argument: prove you cannot edit by editing, ''and'' prove you are a good editor while not being able to edit. Or am I missing something? This proposal also borders on paranoia. Per Vogone, if an editor is untrustworthy then they should not have an IPBE.

So a CU ''may'' refuse an IPBE because other blocked editors used the blocked IP? ''Assuming'' (just accept for argument) the blocked IP is linked with a blocked editor, and the IPBE requester is always linked with a blocked IP, what will be the deciding factor? How will this not always allow preclusion of an IPBE? (For example, I can ''guarantee'' my IP is associated with a blocked editor, so how will this not allow precluding me from getting an IPBE, my 10000 Wikipedia edits notwithstanding? The CU ''may'' deny my IPBE, no?) I also think its reasonable to assume \"may\" means \"will\".

Such actions are done by stewards which presents two problems:\n#Logs are split\n#Actions may not be done in a timely manner\n\nThis currently proves to be successful with other wikis and with the technical abilities available to local bureaucrats, such actions will be local in the logs and such actions will be able to be help accountable to local policies.\n\nAlso note [[meta:Crat#Removing-access|this]] is a nice list of wikis that currently allow bureaucrats to desysop and decrat.\n\n== Allow Bureaucrats to Desysop ==\n{{discussion top|1= I didn't expect this to be an easy close, and I don't expect that this close is going to go over smoothly, but here goes: Bureaucrats '''will not''' be able to desysop at this time. Ultimately, major user rights changes require a clear consensus and, in the absence of such a consensus, the status quo is not changed. Even if we discount entirely the comments made by the stewards and others that have not spent any significant amount of time on the project, support for the change is still only around 66%. However, while there has been significant push-back on this project, on Meta, and over IRC against what is seen as meddling by a small number of Stewards, and even more significant push-back at the perceived messages behind some of those comments, I am not about to entirely disregard the opinions of people who, active on this project or not, have the authorization of the broader WMF project community to act on this project, not just because of their community derived authority, but also because of the experience, and hopefully wisdom, that comes from having reached that point. Finally, when looking at the arguments made on either side of the debate, the arguments on the opposing side are generally better laid out and stronger, while many supporters aren't giving rationales at all. \n\nIn summary:\n* A raw vote count gives the support at a meager 56%. A vote count that discounts the votes of 'drive-by commenters' does't bring it any higher than the mid 60s.\n* The strength of argument is stronger for the opposition than for the supporters.\n* A clear consensus is needed to enact user right changes. Even if this was left open for another month, I doubt that we'd see a consensus develop, and certainly not one in support. \n\nTherefore I am closing this as '''no change/unsuccessful'''. If you want to discuss this further, you know where to find me.

Why this determination in seeking flags, rights and \"powah\"?

I think we've tried to make a clear difference between a \"translator\" and a \"translation admin\", so I'm liking Vogone's proposed group below as an alternative, rather than giving translationadmin permissions to someone who might not fully understand the tool but is a trusted translator. [[User:Legoktm|Legoktm]] ([[User talk:Legoktm|talk]]) 17:20, 23 May 2013 (UTC)\n*Since I noticed I was mentioned, I'd like to add some points regarding the translator group on Incubator whose only right is editprotected. We introduced it in 2007 or so, since we had some features that relied on translation through the MediaWiki namespace. We have since then moved many of that to translatewiki.net, but the group is still useful for giving some users the ability to edit e.g. certain css/js pages without making them sysops (because sysop access would be neither be wanted by them nor justified for them to get). I don't have any statistics, but I think there were probably at least 50 translators in all the time. We had only one case of abuse: [[:incubator:Incubator:Administrators'_noticeboard/Archive/2006-2010#User:Newyorkmets2000|the user messed with Titleblacklist]] to prevent all editing except by sysops. That was of course very suboptimal, but the rights assignment was done a bit naively by us back then. &ndash; For Wikidata, from what I can see with my limited knowledge, it seems like it would be useful to also allow (trusted) non-admins to translate the Translate extension workflow states - and maybe also local modifications of other MW messages. Of course a risk of abuse like we had on Incubator always is there, because MediaWiki has all sorts of weird pages in the MediaWiki: namespace, but I guess it would be very very limited. Translation-admins are not the most unexperienced people and those abusing it will surely face being blocked. --<small>[[User:MF-Warburg|MF-W]]</small> 03:37, 24 May 2013 (UTC)\n\n*I agree that adminship is very easy to \"get\" here, so all \"translationadmin-but-not-admin\"s could simply file a RfA. --<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">[[User:Ricordisamoa|<span style=\"color:#004B70\">Ricordi</span>]][[User talk:Ricordisamoa|<span style=\"color:#00703E\">samoa</span>]]</span> 09:03, 24 May 2013 (UTC)\n**Do trusted translators really need RFD experience, community involvement, etc. just for being able to translate pages?

In my opinion, the situation has to be clarified for Wikidata. Should we allow items linking to locally uploaded files? Or should we only allow files uploaded to [[:commons:|Wikimedia Commons]]?\n\nOne problem with locally uploaded files is that they cannot be included to items via [[Property:P18]], whilst another problem is that unfree pictures do not really fit in the scope of \"free\" knowledge projects and are simply not allowed in all countries due to different legal situations.

No-one's asking for non-free images to be uploaded ''here'', just to link them together in the same way as an article would be. I don't see how Commons is connected to this. Also, one can quite easily link Commons images to an item, as well as the \"logo image\" provision for Commons-eligible logo devices, we already have a \"Commons category\" statement. Simply add the relevant Commons image to that category, then add the category to the item. Easy. To the worries about not all Wikipedias allowing non-free content, I say this: if the respective Wikipedia does have such a ban, then they won't appear in the item, nor will the item appear in their Wikipedia. How could it? There'd be nothing to link it to. [[User:Malpass93|Malpass93]] ([[User talk:Malpass93|talk]]) 18:36, 29 May 2013 (UTC)\n#:Well, commons was created to be the central place where files can be uploaded, making them available from each project and to avoid the necessity for interwiki links. I don't see why we have to do a step back, just because some projects allow to host non-free content locally. If there is a real local need for such linking, the old method (<nowiki>[[xx:xxxx.xxx]]</nowiki>) is still available. Like also for user pages.

The key difference between this and the userpage is that a logo is a quantifiable quality, there's a distinct time it was used, and a time in which it was scrapped. Also, since this project has effectively depreciated the old interwiki system, why not take advantage of this opportunity.

Lewis]] ([[User talk:John F. Lewis|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 15:28, 24 October 2013 (UTC)}}\nThe key for valid statements with proper formatted values are properties. A specific property defines which values are allowed and how they have to be formatted. But since we didn't have any automatically condition/constraint check at the moment a statement is created, there is only hope that the user which create the statement understands the property he is using. So it's important users are able to quickly and easily inform themself about properties. While someone is typing a property name, he get some basic information about this property via a popup message. By clicking the property he lands to the property site, which doesn't give any more information than the popup message beforehand. The real information about the purpose, handling and constraints of a property is hidden in the discussion site (at most cases, e.g. [[Property_talk:P458]]). However, since there is no notification for that, users which aren't familiar with Wikidata wouldn't expect such important information in the discussion site. Thus, the information should be more obvious. In my opinion bringing the property documentation nearer to the user could improve quality of statements. I already mentioned this on the [[WD:PC|project chat]] and on the [[WD:DEV|contact the development team site]], but it didn't get much attention. But since it also need some changes on the technical site, I opened this RfC. So if the outcome is we should change something, we can ask the development team to realize this. It's not the question what the content of the property documentation should be, but if we should move it to the main site of the property. \n\nIn a second question I've an idea how we could realize this very easy. My suggest is to use a standardized subpage, which will automatically included in the main page if it exist. E.g. we could save the property documentation under Property/Documentation. Doing it this way, it's also easier to track changes in the property usage. --[[User:Nightwish62|Nightwish62]] ([[User talk:Nightwish62|talk]]) 10:47, 30 May 2013 (UTC)\n\n== Include property documentation by subpage ==\n:{{support}} --[[User:Nightwish62|Nightwish62]] ([[User talk:Nightwish62|talk]]) 10:47, 30 May 2013 (UTC)\n:{{support}} Unless the devs come up with a way to include this info directly on the main page --[[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 10:48, 1 June 2013 (UTC)\n:{{oppose}} Contributors read main and talk pages.

The main reason which make me think so is, that we just have one level for qualifiers. And if we use 'key event' for the type and the qualifier for the date, we don't have any possibility to define the statement more specific. Example: <Nintendo WII U> key event <publication> date <YYYY-MM-DD> already uses the qualifiers, so we can't add more information like the countries in which the console was released at this date, since there are multiple launch dates in several countries. Ok, I can't see any case where \"date of birth\" or \"date of death\" should have qualifiers, but this doesn't mean there aren't cases. Perhaps there are two different dates for 'real' death and brain death? Having the qualifiers left we could use the qualifier.

This is relevant data, but it could be deduced from preexisting data in a separate item. Should we have a list of rules for when start date or end date could be considered deducible or assumed? We would probably put start and end dates for given names and such if it was changed, but would be put start dates for the name the person was given shortly after birth or end dates for names that the person died with? A problem with a general rule of no start date signifying since birth/start and no end date signifying until death/end is that sometimes we just don't have the data added yet. We can't put \"unknown\", because that's an actual statement saying that it's unknown to the world, and not just unknown to the current Wikidata database. Also, it is sometimes ambiguous: JFK died as President of the United States, so one might think that adding an end date to his term as president would be unnecessary, as it could be deduced from his death date. However, Kim Il-Sung died on 8 July 1994, yet still holds the office of Eternal President of North Korea. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 10:28, 6 June 2013 (UTC)\n:We really lack a way to point out something starts/ends ''because of'' something else. {{Q|451753}}: Her {{P|428}} changed, because her surname (still lacking property for that >.>) changed, because she married. So actually adding the start date of her marriage would be enough, '''if''' there were some way to state the consequences of that. As with your example of JFK: in principle it ''could be'' stated \"ends by: death\", but what if there are multiple possible claims this could refer to (Brandegee had actually been married two times)? To be precise there has to be a way to link a claim to another claim and I can't even imagine this being implemented. The only solution I can think of for these cases would be to create items for each event (e.g. \"event of marriage between M. K. Curran and T. S. Brandegee\") and link all effected claims to it via an item property and state the actual time there, but that's <u>incredibly</u> impractical. \u2014[[User:23PowerZ|<font color=\"red\">\u2605</font>P''\u03bf\u03c9\u03b5\u03c1''<font color=\"black\"><b>Z</b></font>]]<sub><sub>[[User talk:23PowerZ|talk]]</sub></sub> 01:44, 11 June 2013 (UTC)\n::Yes it does sound impractical.

[[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 21:44, 11 June 2013 (UTC)\n::@23PowerZ, a concept to solve this would be some sort of \"sub-items\", i.e. items that can only be created and used within the scope of their \"parent\"-item. For each person, e.g., you could then create a sub-item \"death\" and set all properties like time, place, reason, etc. for it. Then you could use this sub-item as a value for properties of the item. In my opinion, this is what would actually be required for the \"key event\" property as well. With the current datamodel of property-value-qualifier, it can't be implemented properly. However, as we probably all know, this is something that won't come anytime soon (we don't even have a number datatype yet).\n::@Yairrand: I've come across the same question (giving end date for a marriage), and I chose to enter the end date. The reason is that Wikidata is an open project which will never be finished; so if you see a marriage with a start date but no end date given, you can never be sure if it indeed lasted until a spouse's death, or if it didn't and just noone has entered the end date yet. This is the same for public offices - you can only know that JFK kept his office until his death when you know history. Dates, although appearing to be obvious at the time of entering the data, are additional information that you cannot derive, and rules when to enter a date and when not won't be able to help there.--[[User:Kompakt|Kompakt]] ([[User talk:Kompakt|talk]]) 06:45, 12 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n==Anything else?==\n{{discussion bottom}}"

Some of us suggest to remove specific properties for using generic ones (e.g. [[Wikidata:Properties for deletion#Property:P289|deletion request of P:P289]]). With this discussion I (= [[User:Paperoastro|Paperoastro]]) ask to the community what direction we want to take to organize items: few generic type properties or a lot of specific ones?\n\n== A lot of specific type properties ==\n=== Pros ===\n* simple organization of [[Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/Summary|Constraint violations]];\n* no need of specific rules to organize the properties;\n* ''better match the infoboxes and make it easier for editors to find the right items.

We should have every infobox field have a property. Sometimes these can overlap (\"producer\" for a film, \"producer\" for a video game, and \"producer\" for an album all can share a property). There is a fine line between trimming down redundant properties and damaging usability of the data and ease of use for the maintainers and enterers of the data. Given a choice, I'd rather see a few redundant properties than suffer the headache of having to juryrig information into properties that don't fit well.

If we want know that the type of building of Westminster abbey is church, and the info is stored in a type of building property, it is easy to retrieve. If it is buried in the \"instance of\" property, along with things like \"grade I listed building\", it get more tricky. That is theoreitically possible, but an actual, easy-to-use tool would be desirable to see how it can actually work.\n\n=== Discussion ===\nIt depends on the case.  However, if {{P|31}} is reasonable (as in the [[Wikidata:Properties_for_deletion#Property:P289|PFD I listed]]) (and probably the similar {{P|288}}), we should choose that.  This is particularly clear when the class of items exists in the real world, like {{Q|559026}}.  I don't think that should always be a strict requirement (particularly since not all of Wikidata's data is going to be used in infoboxes).  But an item like Q559026 should allow filtering the instance ofs to avoid false positives (i.e. USS Ship is an instance of something besides a ship class, or the church example above) in infoboxes.  This type of filtering requires a fix to [[bugzilla:47930]], since you need to check whether (e.g.) {{Q|309336}} is an instance of {{Q|559026}} when you're on an individual ship's page, such as {{Q|748902}}.

This is a core feature of querying in the Semantic Web -- it's a basic feature of [[:en:SPARQL|SPARQL]], the W3C-recommended querying language for RDF.  I asked about this at [[Wikidata:Contact_the_development_team/Archive/2013/04#Transitive_properties_and_SPARQL]].

This would imply being able to retrieve the class at level n-1 (which would be defined by {{P|289}}) as well as the class at level n-2 (which would be defined by {{P|288}}).

If any of the items it is an subclass of are {{P|31}} waterclass then that is the waterclass of the ship.

Each item for a watercraft type has the property {{P|31}}:watercraft type and {{P|279}}:vehicle type. See my new section below. [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 10:35, 3 June 2013 (UTC)\n: I agree that Wikidata would greatly benefit by supporting [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof rdfs:subPropertyOf], but I disagree that such a property would make it sensible to have a proliferation of domain-specific 'type of' properties.  In other words, I think specifying 'ship class', 'watercraft type', and the arbitrarily large number of 'type of' properties as subproperties of 'instance of' or 'subclass of' would be a poor use of rdfs:subPropertyOf.  \n: Any Wikidata port of rdfs:subPropertyOf should be reserved for specifying deeper subproperty relations, like, say, the relationship between the transitive {{P|361}} property and an intransitive \"direct part\" subproperty (which many supported {{P|463}} as).  Properties like 'ship class' are different from 'instance of' in only a very superficial sense: they specify \"instance of\" relations ''in a specific class''.  I am not aware of any other large ontologies that use rdfs:subPropertyOf in this way.  \n: Beyond needlessly preserving evolutionary precursors of 'instance of' and 'subclass of' -- which domain-specific \"type of\" properties like 'ship class' and 'watercraft type' represent -- I see no reason to use rdfs:subPropertyOf like that. I don't find the assertion that it will reduce confusion for new users compelling: they would still need to look up the appropriate domain-specific \"type of\" property to use in their particular niche of interest, and even then they would still need to know the difference between \"instance of\" and \"subclass of\" to use their niche's custom \"type of\" subproperties accurately.  I think it would be simpler to stick with the two W3C-based \"type of\" properties, and preserve uses of rdfs:subPropertyOf for deeper subproperty relations.  [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 04:41, 4 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n===Property inheritance===\nAfter reading the deletion discussion for {{P|132}} and sleeping on this I  realised there is another way to do some of this which doesn't always need a new\"subproperty\".\n\nHere is an example: {{P|132}} refers to items which are 'administrative units'.  We should ensure each of these 'administrative unit' types have the property {{P|31}} 'administrative unit'. Bots can do sanity checks on edits by checking if the items referenced by P132 are the right type of item as given by their instance of property while we can still have exceptions where needed. \n\nEach 'Administrative unit' item also needs to have the property {{P|279}} 'geographical feature'. Then 'geographical feature' can have the property {{P|107}} 'geographical feature' (or maybe 'instance of:GND Main type'). In this way we create a hierarchy of 'instance of' and 'subclass of' items and you can tell something is an 'instance of' by following the hierarchy. Effectively this is an alternative to the GND hierarchy of types and yes it would mean deleting {{P|107}} from all except a few items at the top of the hierarchy.\n\nThat works for 'instance of' because all items are an 'instance of' something. Other properties will need the subproperty type. Take for example {{P|131}}. This is a subproperty of 'located in' which could be seen as a subproperty of {{P|279}} (if you squint real hard). If we just delete P131 and use only P279 then we lose some useful information and we also lose hints in the property titles which help editors find the right properties and allow bots to do sanity checks.\n\nSimilarly {{P|569}} is a sub-property of 'key event - date' which is a sub-property of 'key event'.\n\nAre there any other properties defined by W3C besides \"instance of', 'subclass of' and 'sub-property of' which we should be considering?

Lets keep all the 'type of' properties for the bottom level of the hierarchy, because they have the useful properties discussed above, and lets use {{P|31}} and {{P|279}} to define a hierarchy of items all the way up from these to whatever main types we happen to arrive at. \n::For other Properties however lets not try to define a hierarchy today. We can come back to that in another RFC later. [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 21:54, 3 June 2013 (UTC)\n* Filceolaire, {{P|361}} is an important property we should also be considering when discussing basic membership properties.  It's based on the working draft [http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/OEP/SimplePartWhole/ Simple part-whole relations in OWL Ontologies]  from the W3C, and represents Wikidata's top-level [[:en:Mereology|mereological]] property.  'located in' (and thus 'is in administrative unit') are really more subproperties of P361 than P279.  \n: As Kolja will tell you, I have been arguing against P107 for the reasons you cite for a while (cf. [[Wikidata:Requests_for_deletions/Archive/2013/Properties#Property:P107|P107 deletion discussion]], etc).  I think it's important to realize that the problem with P107 is not that it's based on the GND, but that it's premised on the idea of \"main types\".  Main types are a taxonomic kludge that have some serious inherent problems; I outlined these in the rejected GND-independent 'main type' property proposal (archived [[Wikidata:Property_proposal/Archive/7#en:Main_type_of_item_.28entity_type.29.2Fru:.D1.82.D0.B8.D0.BF_.D1.8D.D0.BB.D0.B5.D0.BC.D0.B5.D0.BD.D1.82.D0.B0_.28.D0.BE.D1.81.D0.BD.D0.BE.D0.B2.D0.BD.D0.BE.D0.B9_.D1.82.D0.B8.D0.BF.29.2Fde:Entit.C3.A4t_.28Typ.29.2Ffr:type_principal_.28entit.C3.A9.29|here]]).\n: So I think having multiple \"main types\" (whether GND or not) at the root of Wikidata's type hierarchy is not a good idea.  Wikidata's type hierarchy should have a single root.  Most large ontologies are rooted at a rough approximation of {{Q|35120}} (aka \"thing\"), which is what I've used as the root while manually building a type hierarchy with {{P|279}}.  The type hierarchy should also not contain any [[:en:Cycle_%28graph_theory%29|cycles]].  In other words, I think Wikidata's type hierarchy -- its taxonomy of all knowledge -- should be a [[:en:Directed_acyclic_graph|DAG]] with a single root at \"entity\".  There is slightly less agreement among widely used [[:en:Upper ontology|upper ontologies]] about which items appear below the root, but nothing like GND's \"person\" type appears there. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 04:17, 4 June 2013 (UTC)\n::The Wikidata type hierarchy seems to be heading towards 2 roots. \"Item\" for all the item pages and \"Wikipedia non-item page\" for all the wikipedia pages which have wikidata pages but which don't correspond to single items which can be described in statements. I suppose the root joining these would be \"wikidata page\". [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 10:50, 4 June 2013 (UTC)\n::: I don't see a need for two roots, for two reasons.  Firstly, I don't think classifying Wikimedia entities is valuable enough to be in scope for Wikidata.  Secondly, even if it were, I don't see anything that ontologically distinguishes Wikimedia entities like WikiProjects, templates, etc. from all other subjects in the world.  If we were to pursue the (misguided, in my opinion) goal of classifying internal Wikimedia entities in addition to the rest of the world, then I would suggest that \"Wikidata page\" be a subclass of \"entity\" -- and probably not a direct subclass.  Having things the other way around seems like it would be a basic, mistaken inversion for a taxonomy of all knowledge.  It would also be different from all other knowledge representation systems that I'm aware of. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 02:07, 5 June 2013 (UTC)\n:::: Precisely, but in my own the question is not ''is it valuable enough to be in scope of wikidata'', but ''is it valuable enough to be usefull for wikimedia''.

A side note: these \"large, general-interest databases\" are called [[:en:Ontology_(information_science)|ontologies]].

[[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 22:46, 13 December 2013 (UTC)\n\n===Another Procedural question===\nWe use '{{P|31}}:{{Q|Q571}}' for {{Q|Q1845}} and for {{Q|Q1816474}}.  This is a problem with all sorts of mass produced items (except ships). Is a mass produced item an instance of a brand/model/copyright/design or is it a class of objects? [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 22:46, 13 December 2013 (UTC)\n: It is a class, [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]].  The claim {{Q|1845}} {{P|31}} {{Q|571}} is incorrect because the Bible is a ''type'' of book that has particular, concrete instances.  The overwhelming majority of items about books on Wikidata are about such classes of object.  The Lincoln Bible is an instance of a book -- more specifically, {{Q|1816474}} {{P|31}} {{Q|1845}}.  Items about instances of books are rare in Wikidata, but they're a great illustration of how the class-instance distinction applies.\n: If an item has instances, then it is a class.  {{Q|182323}} is a class of car, {{Q|826174}} is an instance of a car; {{Q|309336}} is a class of ship, {{Q|211658}} is an instance of a ship; {{Q|1116374}} is a class of tree, {{Q|590039}} is an instance of a tree; {{Q|5}} is a class of mammal, {{Q|187520}} is an instance of a mammal.\n: The fact that a mass-produced item is a class does not mean that information about branding, copyright, design, authorship, etc. cannot be captured.  Properties like that apply to a class and are inherited by its instances.  Consider the soft drink {{Q|2813}}.  Yes, Coca-Cola is a brand of cola, but a \"brand\" is a type.  Properties like \"calories per serving\", \"manufactured by\", \"[http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/#heading-2 trademark]\", etc. apply to the brand (i.e. type) and are inherited by all its instances.

A DVD is more like a container of digital copies of the work, each of the copies is technically (philosophically speaking) a {{Q'|945419}} virtual episode representation, as a book which contains a play text is a virtual performance based on that text.\n\n===Catalogs and Authority Control===\nThe area where we have the largest number of domain specific properties is in links to authority control and other types of database. Nearly all the properties with datatype 'string'  are in this category and they make up about a third of our properties. The whole lot could be replaced by {{P|528}} with qualifier {{P|972}}.

Thanks, [[User:DavidMCEddy|DavidMCEddy]] ([[User talk:DavidMCEddy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:58, 22 March 2020 (UTC)\n\n===Which data type to use for names?===\n(A lot of the above was written with the assumption that the item datatype would be used. Feel free to add sections about how to deal with issues that only come up if a different data type is used.) One option for the datatype of each of these properties/this property would be the Item datatype; the value could be set to the item for the name, with each name having its own item. In [[WD:PP/P#given_name_.2F_Vorname_.2F_pr.C3.A9nom|this discussion]], [[User:\u0160lomo]] proposed that MultilingualTextValue be used instead, saying \"MultilingualTextValue seems more suitable since the use of personal names' translations/transliterations is different for particular names, languages and even persons and can't be simply linked to a Wikidata item dealing with name in general.\", and [[User:Beta16]] said that \"String or MultilinguaText are better.\" [[User:Snipre]] opposed having data for specific parts of names at all, saying \"Better to have one property \"Full name\" including last and surname\". \n\n====Use Item datatype====\n*{{support}}. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 01:30, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n*{{S}} for individual given names and family names.

[[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 21:46, 19 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n====Use String datatype====\n\n{{support}} Items are about concepts, not words, but names ''are'' words. That creates two sorts of issues: \n* practical: it is very sensitive to small imperfections like approximate interwikis. If someone is called [[:en:John]], should we use [[Q397210]] that links to both [[:en:John]] and [[:ja:\u30e8\u30cf\u30cd]] ? I dont think so, as [[:ja:\u30e8\u30cf\u30cd]] appears to include de:Johannes and fr:Jean that are different names for most practical purposes.  \n* conceptual: if an American of Korean descent is called \"Lee\", should her surname be [[:en:Lee (Korean name)]] or [[:en:Lee (surname)]] ?  I would say [[:en:Lee (surname)]] , because really she is just called \"Lee\" no matter whether her grand-father was  called  \uc774, Lee, or \u674e. And if so, \"Lee\" is really just a meaningless string, and it does not make much sense to use items. --[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|talk]]) 05:15, 19 June 2013 (UTC)\n*:I would think that if the names an article describes don't match up to that of the rest of the articles linked to by the item, the sitelink could be removed and a separate item created for the article. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 23:39, 25 June 2013 (UTC)\n*::My mistake, [[:ja:\u30e8\u30cf\u30cd]] actually does not include Johannes. Still even if my first point is solved, I do not think it adequately solves the problem, as point 2 remains (two names that are spelled the same way can have different items). We can probably create items to solve that as well, but I am not sure it really makes sense. Why should we use items ? The reasons I see are:\n# attach a meaning, like \"he is called John - a name given in memory of John the Baptist\". But in many cases, that is raher tricky. What is common between the \"Lee\" of [[:en:General Lee]] and the Lee of [[:en:Lee Kuan Yew]] ? Sure, in this case, we could make a bit of genealogical research and find meaningful items, but doing that for ''every'' person seems next to impossible to me.  \n# make translations easier. But I am not convinced that it is better done through items than through templates. For instance, the same Chinese name will be transcribed differently in English depending on whether the person is Chinese or Taiwanese. --[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|talk]]) 06:40, 26 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n====Discussion====\n\n===Start/end dates===\nShould start date and end date qualifiers be used for a person's original names and names that a person had until death, respectively? Over at [[WD:Requests for comment/Time DataType Properties]], it was suggested that (within the general topic of start/end dates) start and end dates should be given even if they go all the way to the start or end of a person's life, as otherwise it would be impossible to tell if perhaps the data hadn't been added yet. In my personal opinion, even if that is to be the standard, names should be an exception, as it is extremely common that names don't change. Thoughts? --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 01:30, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n===Pseudonym===\nPseudonyms are a bit more complicated than the other name elements, as they frequently take the form of full names themselves, complete with pseudonymous given names and surnames. Even more problematic is that they occasionally get inserted into a person's real name, as in the case of [[w:J. K. Rowling|Joanne Kathleen Rowling]]. Any ideas as to the best way to store this data? --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 01:30, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n===People with different names in different languages===\nSome people have had different names in different languages, while others have been referred to by different names in places where other languages are spoken, without it ever having actually been their name. How should such information be included, if at all? --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 01:30, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n:Use some string-related type, with language qualifiers :). I do not think there is any other way to say that Aristotle is called Aristote in French. --[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|talk]]) 19:48, 19 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n===Fictional character names===\nShould fictional characters have name data provided, and if so, should they use the same type of naming system as people? If they do, and the item type is chosen for name properties, should separate items be created for fictional names even if only held by a single character? Also, how should characters that have different names in different language versions be dealt with? --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 01:30, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n===Name signs===\nWe might be best off just ignoring these until real support for SignWriting is available... --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 01:30, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n:In principal this depends on whether the name sign is considered to be a transliteration of a name (sign name is a qualifier to the name) or a separate name (sign name is a separate name entry) [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 21:51, 19 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n===Exceptional names===\nOccasionally, there are names that don't fit into any normal system. One example is [[w:Prince (musician)]], who changed his name to a symbol that can not be pronounced or represented in unicode. Should such cases be simply ignored, or should we try to find some way to include it? --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 01:30, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n===Titles, honorifics===\nThe properties {{P|97}} and {{P|511}} have already been created. Are these a full solution to titles and honorifics? Also, do they overlap? --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 01:30, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n:They don't overlap. You could be styled \"the right honourable\" but not \"third Marquess Calgary\", the former being an honourific prefix and the latter being a noble title. The honourific prefixes get shoved in front of the name, the noble title replaces the name itself (or is used in conjunction with, e.g. John Snow, fifth Duke of Windsor). [[User:Ajraddatz|Ajraddatz]] <small>([[User Talk:Ajraddatz|Talk]])</small> 14:12, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n===Anything else?===\nHow about the pronunciation of names? actually this is a general issue, even for name places? Should this be just a qualifier? For names that are not latin characters, maybe romanticized pronunciation qualifier could be used.\n--[[User:Napoleon.tan|Napoleon.tan]] ([[User talk:Napoleon.tan|talk]]) 15:58, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n:I think that pronunciations are more within the scope of Wiktionary than of Wikipedia-linked Wikidata items. Names that are not in Latin characters would typically have a transliterated label in languages with other scripts, so that doesn't seem to be an issue. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 23:43, 25 June 2013 (UTC)\n\nI've requested a new bot task related to this RFC at [[Wikidata:Requests for permissions/Bot/SLiuBot 3]].

Properties for deletion is not an effective method of resolving such a complex disagreement, and therefore I have started an RfC on the matter.\n\nNote that we've already modified the GND with the addition of the 'disambiguation page' option. If you want to make further modifications to it (i.e. you feel that GND main type is mostly fine but could use some tweaking), that isn't option a, that is option b, because at this point we're pretty much making up our own system.\n\nFor the purposes of this RfC, I define \"primary sorting property\" as \"a property that is applied to a majority/plurality of items for the purpose of separating those items into a limited number of broad categories\". This is what P107 does now; it separates everything into person, organization, event, creative work, term, place, or disambiguation page. \n\nIn a perfect world, we would be able to solve this issue in one RfC, but I think it might take two. Therefore the primary objective of this RfC is to determine which of the three above options to go with. If necessary, a second RfC can be held to flush out details (in case option b is chosen).\n\nYours, [[User:Sven Manguard|<span style=\"color:#207004\">'''<span style=\"font-size:115%\">S</span>ven <span style=\"font-size:115%\">M</span>anguard'''</span>]] [[User talk:Sven Manguard|<small><span style=\"color:#F0A804\">'''Wha?'''</span></small>]] 18:15, 30 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n==a) Wikidata should retain P107 as is==\n# GND type is notable classification system, no need to remove it from Wikidata and no need to extend it.

These endless discussions are the reason I now spend again more time with Wikipedia than Wikidata. Imho Wikidata main types of items (based on GND, with \"disambiguation\" and \"non-articles\") are helpful and have improved the quality of data. (If you take for example a look at [[Wikidata:Infoboxes task force]] or [[Wikidata:List of properties]] you can see that the main types have been used for the structure for Wikidata even before P107 has been established.) There is no problem to use P31 etc. with {{P|107}}. The only problem with P107 seems to be it's success.

However, every Wikidata Item can have as many properties as it likes. Wikidata as a whole can support as many 'main types' as it likes (although it would be funny because none of them would really be acting as a 'main type'). Competing ontologies can exist; if you like a different 'main type' just add it, if you don't like 'main types' at all, just ignore P107. Are we worried that P107 will start to bias what we'll add to Wikidata, that it will make our contributions more German?

A core feature of querying in the Semantic Web is that a query for \"People born in the Twentieth century\" would pull in {{Q|567}} even if she's only classified as {{P|31}} {{Q|82955}}, because {{Q|82955}} {{P|279}} {{Q|215627}}.  So we can have the generality in querying you describe without relying on kludges like P107 and other \"main type\" properties.\n#: But let's say you want to get back \"People born in the Twentieth century\" using a query along the lines of \"get me items that have a P107 value of 'person'\".  In addition to people, your result would include any fictional characters, gods or spirits that were said to be born in the 20th century.  This is because P107's \"person\" type includes types of things that are well outside the definition of \"person\".  There are similar problems for other P107 main types.  These basic misclassifications negate the value of P107 and other \"main type\" properties as simple querying aids.  These problems don't exist with {{P|31}} and {{P|279}}, i.e. the approach suggested by Option C.

[[User:Littledogboy|Littledogboy]] ([[User talk:Littledogboy|talk]]) 16:21, 17 July 2013 (UTC)\n#::: English Wikipedia infoboxes are a reasonable starting point for classification with {{P|31}} and {{P|279}}.  And if we look at the infobox for [[:en:Angela Merkel|Angela Merkel]], we see she's classified with [[:en:Template:Infobox officeholder|Infobox officeholder]], not [[:en:Template:Infobox person|Infobox person]].  [[:en:Template:Infobox politician|Infobox politician]] redirects to Infobox officeholder, so I think it's plausible to assert that Wikipedia classifies Angela Merkel not just as a person, but further as a politician.  And it's entirely reasonable to consider \"politician\" a subclass of \"person\".  This is what DBpedia and at least one other large ontology does (see [http://mappings.dbpedia.org/server/ontology/classes/Politician], [http://umbel.org/relationbrowser?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fumbel.org%2Fumbel%2Frc%2FPolitician]).\n#::: One of the biggest misconceptions about {{P|31}} is that it's somehow appropriate to use for any random claim one might make about a subject (\"a mother (?), a university graduate, non-vegetarian, professor emeritus (?)\").  That's not how P31 (i.e. [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_type rdf:type]) should be used.  Otherwise, we might as well do away with the vast majority of properties, and use {{P|31}} instead!  No: P31 is for putting an instance into a taxonomy of classes, and a subject's class should entail more than a few novel properties for the subject.\n#::: But this P31 pontification is beside the point.  The larger point in my comment to Paperoastro is that basing our classification system on rdf:type and rdfs:subClassOf (i.e., P31 and P279) -- among other major benefits -- would also help us to more easily take advantage of powerful features in Semantic Web querying.  If \"Angela Merkel {{P|31}} politician; politician {{P|279}} person\" doesn't work for you, there are many other relevant examples: \"{{Q|152907}} instance of {{Q|3863}}, {{Q|3863}} subclass of {{Q|6999}}\"; \"{{Q|189588}} subclass of ... {{Q|12078}}, {{Q|12078}} subclass of {{Q|12136}}\"; \"{{Q|144}} subclass of ... {{Q|7377}}, {{Q|7377}} subclass of ... {{Q|729}}\"; etc.  Using the standards-based P31 and P279 properties for classification would better position Wikidata to take advantage of tools for the Semantic Web like type inference in [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/ SPARQL], visualizing type hierarchies in [http://protege.stanford.edu/ Protege], and more easily mapping Wikidata's ontology to many other Semantic Web ontologies for import and export.  And this is not mutually exclusive with actually using these classifications in Wikipedia.  Insofar as P107 or other \"main type\" or \"infobox type\" properties are concerned, I think P31 and P279 would be just as easy to integrate into Wikipedia.

The more I use it, the more I think P107 sucks: it's often counter-intuitive, it's particularly confusing to non-German users because translations that gave us \"event\" and \"term\" are imperfect, and we're basically forced to go with whatever poor choices were made by the German National Library. We'll still have {{P|227}} and if we do things right, it should be easy for bots to deduce the GND type of an item even after P107 is gone. That being said, some form of high-level classification is a good thing and I think we should encourage people to use {{P|31}} with a fairly small set of possible values. {{P|279}} will be more open-ended but I think it makes sense to tell people that each item should have at least one P31 or P279 statement. [[User:Pichpich|Pichpich]] ([[User talk:Pichpich|talk]]) 00:56, 4 July 2013 (UTC)\n#: Restricting the use of {{P|31}} to a small set of possible values would be a doubly bad idea: we would not only be instituting the mistake of having a \"main type\" property, but also effectively delete the general-purpose instantiation property we have in P31.  Not using a \"main type\" property does not mean that we couldn't have high-level types.  We can have high-level classes for person, organization, event, etc. without a P107-like \"main type\" property and with simply {{P|31}} and {{P|279}} -- this is what the rest of the Semantic Web does.\n#: The problem with ''any'' \"main type\" property is that it inevitably runs into the same problems as P107.  The problem with P107 isn't that it's based on the GND ontology or that it's from a German library; the problem is that it's a \"main type\" property.  A \"main type\" property -- i.e., a property that attempts to define all items' types by selecting from a fairly small list of high-level type values -- will need to either A) have many, many \"main types\" or B) force many, many subjects into a catch-all \"main type\" (like P107's infamous \"term\" main type).

A main type property -- whether it is confined to the GND as P107 is or not -- is a bad idea, as I argued in the [[Wikidata:Property_proposal/Archive/7#en:Main_type_of_item_.28entity_type.29.2Fru:.D1.82.D0.B8.D0.BF_.D1.8D.D0.BB.D0.B5.D0.BC.D0.B5.D0.BD.D1.82.D0.B0_.28.D0.BE.D1.81.D0.BD.D0.BE.D0.B2.D0.BD.D0.BE.D0.B9_.D1.82.D0.B8.D0.BF.29.2Fde:Entit.C3.A4t_.28Typ.29.2Ffr:type_principal_.28entit.C3.A9.29|rejected property proposal for 'main type']].  My argument against such properties, including P107, remains the same:\n#: \"Main types\" are a taxonomic [[:en:kludge|kludge]] for systems that don't support multiple levels of hierarchical classification.  In a project to structure all knowledge -- which Wikidata is -- restricting items into a small set of types will inevitably lead to classifications that are either A) too broad to be useful or B) simply incorrect.  In other words, whether it is based on the GND or not, an ontology that classifies things with \"main types\" will inevitably end up with problems like the uselessly broad \"term\" main type in [[P:P107|GND main type]] (P107), or simply incorrect classifications like families and literary figures as GND main type 'person'.  Again, to emphasize: the fact that P107 is based on \"main types\" is a bigger problem than the fact that it is based on the GND.  Let's not repeat that mistake.\n#: There is a better solution: use \"type\" properties recommended for the Semantic Web by the [[:en:W3C|W3C]] -- that is, use [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_type rdf:type] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof rdfs:subClassOf].  These properties exist in Wikidata as [[P:P31|instance of]] (P31) and [[P:P279|subclass of]] (P279).  These properties have been part of [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema W3C recommendations for the Semantic Web] for almost a decade.  They are fundamental properties used in large controlled vocabularies to structure data into knowledge.  They enable the [[:en:type-token distinction|important distinction]] between a type (class) and a token (instance).  They facilitate classification at an arbitrary granularity; together 'instance of' and 'subclass of' can classify all subjects and be used to determine precisely where each subject exists in the hierarchy of knowledge.  Not only do they solve those structural problems of P107 and other \"main type\" properties, but by being based on W3C recommendations, [[P:P31|instance of]] (P31) and [[P:P279|subclass of]] (P279) also make Wikidata more interoperable with the rest of the Semantic Web. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 18:47, 30 June 2013 (UTC)\n# What Emw said. Trying to coerce millions of objects into seven main categories is a pointless, fruitless task. The argument for P107 seems to be \"well, German Wikipedia use it\". But what they use it for seems utterly pointless. Verifying Wikipedia against a type that doesn't actually accurately reflect reality in a meaningful, logical or reasonable way is just GIGO: garbage in, garbage out. Nobody has yet presented a compelling use case for P107 beyond \"well, German Wikipedia use it\" (albeit for something that doesn't actually serve any real use) and that it matches up with an existing ontology (albeit one nobody has made a compelling case for the relevance of). This RfC is predicated on the idea that P107 ''or something like P107'' could serve a role as a \"primary sorting property\". I fail to see what use that would be. How would it \"sort\" the data? The argument goes that without something like P107, Wikidata would become anarchic, unnavigable and unusable. That we need a top-down hierarchical controlled ontology otherwise people will just tag things with anything, and complete anarchy will be the only rule. Just like it has on Wikipedia, a project where anyone can edit anything... or on the wider web. This explains why Yahoo!'s directory is a much more useful navigation aid than Google. The whole mode of thinking of the P107-loving formal ontology written by librarians crowd is pre-Web thinking.

Your attempt to argue this point only adds another: We do not need constraints on what we declare something To Be.<p>On another hand, however, we do need to be able to verify that what we have declared something to be is actually what we say it is, and that gets into another reason main types are awful for our particular circumstance: We will fundamentally be unable to verify, for however many edge cases might arise [and any number of the cases which are not edge cases! see \"term\" in GND world] whether thing A is actually a type of main thing B. This is especially true when we tie ourselves to a particular ontology for a main type, if that's a choice that is made, since we must not only verify that item A is a type of main thing B, but also that item A is a type of main thing B in the context of ontology C. It is literally impossible to verify the second claim with e.g. the GND ontology because the GND ontology only covers some 300,000 items in ''their'' database; currently the GND main type is used on well over 3 million in ours.

Leaving the primary property choice open would help to ensure that the general classification suits the Wikimedia projects content as well as possible. [[User:Alexander Doria|Alexander Doria]] ([[User talk:Alexander Doria|talk]]) 18:48, 30 June 2013 (UTC)\n* <p>The introduction to this RFC seems to assume there's consensus to use P107 to classify non-article items.  There isn't.  The overwhelming majority of contributors to [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/Non-article items for property:p107]] have voted \"no\" to the idea of using P107 to classify non-article items with new value (2 yes, 8 no).<p>I think the more relevant question is: why should we be classifying internal details of Wikipedia at all?  We should be classifying the world, not internal details of Wikipedia.  We shouldn't use P107, P31 or anything else to classify non-article items; we shouldn't be classifying them at all.  Classifying Wikipedia projects, templates, categories, etc. seems like encyclopedic [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/navel-gazing navel-gazing]. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 19:01, 30 June 2013 (UTC)\n*: One of the main goals of Wikidata is to serve the projects of the Wikimedia foundation. Since those items are already in the database for interwikis, a bot can easily classify them with almost no additional cost, so why not ? It's free, so lets do it and maybe find usecases such as make statistics easyly without parsing dumps.\n*: There is no need for a main type for that, just that the type of all Media* projects is a subtype of a main item ''Mediawiki pages'' or something like that. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]]) 19:08, 30 June 2013 (UTC)\n*:: So let's say we're content to (in my opinion) encyclopedically navel-gaze, and we want some way to classify non-mainspace Wikimedia pages.  In that case, it seems we might agree: there is no need for a main type property, whether it be P107 or option B as proposed above.  ''If'' we are to put these internal Wikipedia details into our taxonomy of all things, then I don't think we need a separate property to do that.  These internal Wikipedia pages are fundamentally either an [[Property:P31|instance]] or a [[Property:P279|class]].  For example we might say:\n*::* {{Q|8358277}} {{P|279}} Wikipedia category page\n*::* Wikipedia category page {{P|279}} Wikipedia page\n*::* Wikipedia page {{P|279}} Wikimedia page\n*::* Wikimedia page {{P|279}} {{Q|36774}}\n*::* {{Q|36774}} {{P|279}} ...\n*::* ... {{P|279}} {{Q|35120}}\n*:: This would allow us to speak somewhat reflectively using the same fundamental properties used to classify the rest of Wikidata's items.  Importantly, if Wikidata ever incorporates a robust [[:en:Semantic_reasoner|semantic reasoner]] (e.g. [http://jena.apache.org/ Jena], [http://clarkparsia.com/pellet/ Pellet], etc.), it seems like it would allow us to reason about those internal resources with out-of-the-box features. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 19:34, 30 June 2013 (UTC)\n*::: Yes, and in the meantime, we could introduce controlled redudancy, for example add a second ''instance of'' or ''subclass'' claim with the items we might use as main types to emulate basic reasoning.

This would not actually add information for a reasoner, but could help those who wants to query a main type a bit. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]]) 10:41, 1 July 2013 (UTC)\n* I think best way will be: rename P107 to ''Wikidata main type''.

It's based on W3C recommendations ([http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof rdfs:subClassOf]) for this sort of thing, allows for very high or very low levels of granularity in classification, and would give a better foothold for more advanced Semantic Web features.

The fact that it is an astronomical object is deducable from the fact that the class of the instance will be a subclass of ''astronomical object'', if we do not want to make deductions we can precise a (redundant because it is deducable by transitivify of the subclass property) statement which states exactly that <Item> ''instance of'' <astronomical object>, as <astronomical object> should be a root of this classification. I however see the value into just using {{P|31}} instead of {{P|60}} : bots or human will always have the same property for classification, this will enable to build generic bots that can do trans-domain stuffs, they will not have to be specialized to handle corner cases, and humans will have to learn the use of instance of and subclass of once and for all, and not asking themselves ''so, how does these biologists to say it is a mushroom type ?

At now, in this and other similar discussions, we are divided in two sides: adopting Semantic Web or adopting an own system to organize data (I know, this is a strong simplification!). I want to try to move this discussion from theory to practice: at now, to manage and check millions of items we have two tools: queries (when they will became available), and [[Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/Summary|Constraint violation]] instrument. Properties as {{P|132}}, {{P|168}}, {{P|60}}, {{P|289}} are imho the best technical solution '''now available''' to use these tools, even if they have known limits (as well described by Emw with the example of \"People born in the Twentieth century\"). Before to decide to use Semantic Web rules or other systems, we have to verify at least two technical questions:\n# with {{P|60}} property, we can search astronomical objects with the query ''find an item with P60 property''. With Semantic Web, it is also possible, using {{P|31}}, {{P|279}} and inheritance. But, '''is this feature supported by Wikidata'''?\n# With [[Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/P60|one click]] we can check the violations in the classification of astronomical objects. Removing P60 to adopt other systems '''will be possible make the same check, and how'''?\nSimilar examples can be made also for the other properties listed above. So, if we want to change how organize data, I'd like we discuss not only on which system to use, but also on what tools they offer us and if they are supported by Wikidata. --[[User:Paperoastro|Paperoastro]] ([[User talk:Paperoastro|talk]]) 09:09, 12 July 2013 (UTC)\n\n== Proposal: Infoboxed main type ==\n\nPlaying with P31 and P297 is all good and well, but what is really needed is stuff for Wikipedias. We need to figure out how to improve infoboxes, tables, how to replace categories. We need a '''main type with one value for each infobox''', and also one property for each value of an infobox. (If you replace {{P|54}} with {{P|361}}, which by the way does not carry the same meaning, I think, how will this be useful for an infobox about a baseball player?) We can play with semanticWikidata and see how it evolves, but, like Paperoastro says, not any time soon will it be useful. For now, we need a good value store. [[User:Littledogboy|Littledogboy]] ([[User talk:Littledogboy|talk]]) 16:01, 12 July 2013 (UTC)\n:I agree that we need a bunch of types, mostly corresponding to infobox templates. Please don't call these main types as that phrase does upset some people and these wouldn't be main types anyway. They would be base classes linked to more general classes by the 'Subclass of' property. [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 16:33, 12 July 2013 (UTC)\n::Agreed.

[[User:Littledogboy|Littledogboy]] ([[User talk:Littledogboy|talk]]) 19:56, 12 July 2013 (UTC)\n:Such property can be useful, but please don't name it \"main type\" or \"base class\". Let's call it \"Wikipedia infobox\" property. (We also have {{P|373}}, which is similar in some sense.) Come to think of it, direct mapping to infoboxes is really the most useful and unambiguous \"homegrown type system\" Wikidata can provide, if any. And it's already time-proven. \n:I also propose that values for this property should be infobox template items instead of general entity items. This way it will not duplicate  or compete with {{P|31}} statements, which I think will be used anyway regardless of infoboxes, GND or whatever it be. --[[User:4th-otaku|4th-otaku]] ([[User talk:4th-otaku|talk]]) 23:06, 12 July 2013 (UTC)\n:The problem with this proposal (notion of an infobox type) is that different wikis have different templates for the same topics. Additionally, those infobox are usually named differently, whether because they have been translated in name or otherwise. Also, I don't see how it's valuable... \n:As for one property for each field of an infobox, I disagree. The infobox data ''needs'' to fit within the scheme of Wikidata, so one, separate, unique parameter for each different infobox should not be expected. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|talk]]) 21:42, 15 July 2013 (UTC)\n::I agree. Fortunately no one is proposing we have a new property for every field in an infobox. We are proposing we have a page for each infobox topic where we discuss what is the best property for each field in the infoboxes for that topic, taking account of the variations between languages. Part of that discussion will be reviewing what existing properties can be reused. [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 12:25, 16 July 2013 (UTC)\n: An \"infobox main type\" property would be redundant with {{P|31}} and {{P|279}}.  The entire point of classifying subjects with P31 or P279 is to entail a set of other properties (i.e., infobox parameters) about that subject.  The name of an infobox should correspond to the subject's P31 or P279 value.  \n: This proposal's appeal seems to be based on the idea that it would be more practical than the Semantic Web-based approach.  But is it?  How would an \"infobox main type\" property actually be incorporated into Wikipedia infoboxes?  I would suggest that a similar mechanism could be used by {{P|31}} and {{P|279}}.\n: \"Playing around\" with W3C recommendations for specifying a subject's type is not only well and good, but also necessary if we expect to be interoperable with the Semantic Web.  The notion that we should we wait around to see how a so-called Semantic Wikidata evolves before integrating P31 and P279 into our work indicates a misconception about this project -- saying \"Semantic Wikidata\" is like saying \"Encylopedia Wikipedia\".  Wikidata is a knowledgebase that is being built with vocabulary from the Semantic Web.  If we want a type system -- which there seems to be widespread agreement on -- then we should build that with {{P|31}} and {{P|279}}, the W3C recommendations for specifying a subject's type.

A proposal to replace all infobox names with P31 or P279 is ambitious and in my opinion a good in the long run, but I don't think this would be best served by adding a bot request to add P31/P279 claims en masse right now.

Bots should only import unreferenced statements from Wikipedia if these statements match one of these exceptions.

There's no reason to have an exemption for bots.\n#'''On Wikidata, bots set the example''' Bots have the capability of adding millions of statements in a matter of weeks. Anyone who's sifted through the current Wikidata knows that at least 90% (and probably much more) of the current statements have been added by bots. If we allow bots to add millions of unreferenced statements, it will be impossible to ask human users to add sources to their statements when all they see are unreferenced statements. It will also be impossible to argue that Wikidata is serious about sourcing.\n#'''Wikipedias will turn away from Wikidata if Wikidata turns away from sourcing'''. All Wikipedias have increasingly strict sourcing policies. If Wikidata is careless about sourcing, its data can't reasonably be included automatically in infoboxes.\n#'''Blind data imports from Wikipedias can create an echo chamber of dubious data'''. en.wiki, de.wiki and fr.wiki (to cite only those three) specifically warn against using other Wikipedias or Wikipedia mirrors as sources. Blind imports from Wikipedia do exactly that and create a mechanism for disseminating dubious data and mistakes from one Wikipedia to the next.\n#'''Sourcing requirements make life more difficult for bots but it does not make their life impossible'''. Many basic statements do not require a source and can be imported by bots. These form the backbone of Wikidata and there's still a vast amount to import. Moreover, bots can import statements from reliable sources, including specialized databases. This is more complicated because specialized databases have a limited scope and because information might be more complicated to harvest. You won't be able to get 50 thousand statements from 50 lines of code but you will get properly referenced data. There are already bots planning to do this.\n\n[[User:Pichpich|Pichpich]] ([[User talk:Pichpich|talk]]) 19:38, 4 July 2013 (UTC)\n* {{oppose}} Some editors make their best to import the bureaucracy of Wikipedia.

It's also misleading to claim that the unsourced data (and potentially bad data, vandalized data and so on) will remain in the infobox whether we import or not because Wikidata has the potential of taking bad data from one wiki and turning it into bad data on 286 wikis which doesn't sound like progress to me.

''Reference needed'' is a strong incentive to add a source without losing the information that it has currently no source. In those cases, they could display the information that might? have or not a source in the Wikipedia, just as before, or generate a list ''infobox that have sources here not imported in wikipedia''. It's not a question of wether or not import as I see things, It's a question on how we encourage people to add source.

Plus there is more beautiful and less polluting ways to do the same thing (the reference needed template), like a different color and a link to point to the Wikidata statement.

If this would be wrong you can't oppose with your argumentation against adding birth and death dates by bot <small>([[Wikidata:Requests for permissions/Bot/SamoaBot 26]])</small> --[[User:Pyfisch|Pyfisch]] ([[User talk:Pyfisch|talk]]) 16:23, 7 July 2013 (UTC)\n*::::Please don't distort my record. I do not oppose bots adding statements: I oppose bots adding unreferenced statements when these statements require a reference. I have been supportive of bots that add statements that don't require a source (such as [[Wikidata:Requests for permissions/Bot/SamoaBot 33]]) and I've been supportive of bots that add non-trivial statements when they do so based on a reliable source (such as [[Wikidata:Requests for permissions/Bot/SamoaBot 32]]). My proposal above explicitly makes room for bots in both of these categories. As for the case of John Hartford, this is a perfect example of \"common knowledge\" or as  Felix Reimann puts it above statements \"needed to identify the concept of an item\". Anyone with a passing knowledge of Hartford knows that he's a singer-songwriter and in fact that's the only reason why he has a Wikipedia article. Common knowledge is not what is literally known to everybody as it is not hard to find people who don't know that the sun is a star, people who don't know that John Lennon is a member of The Beatles and people who don't know that Brumaire is a month of the French Republican Calendar. But all these statements are still common knowledge as nobody in their right mind would challenge them or tag the corresponding sentence with a citation needed tag on Wikipedia. On the other hand only a ridiculously small percentage of people familiar with the Sun and John Lennon know that the Sun's absolute magnitude is 4.83 or that John Lennon was born on 9 October 1940. These statements should be sourced properly on Wikipedia and they should be sourced properly here.

Some Wikipedia versions do not have a ''citation needed'' tag for specific statements and most have very few experts who could note (widespread) errors in articles on more or less fringe subjects. But maybe our difference of opinion lies just in the long term vision of Wikidata. I personally think it should be as a whole more reliable than Wikipedia and rather say nothing about a specific property of an item than something that is unsourced and possibly plain wrong or misleading. --[[User:HHill|HHill]] ([[User talk:HHill|talk]]) 11:01, 6 August 2013 (UTC)\n*::::: My long term vision is that anything that is possible to do if the datas are not imported for Wikidata from Wikipedia is also possible to do if they are. In the meantime those datas are already on the (at least local) Wikipedias so trying to import them on a single point will help to find inconsistencies between Wikipedia and put the focus on unrealiable datas that are already in Wikipedias. So in the long run the import solution is not wronger than the non import solution, if not better because it as incentive to work on the datas, the mass imports with sources will be exactly the same. The alternative proposal does not advocate for unreliable mass imports. So in my opinion it's better to find good incentive for Wikipedians to work on the datas we already have in Wikipedias to improve their quality, not to make ''tabula rasa'' from them, as local WIkipedia with strong requirements can filter them to avoid WIkipedia imported datas without proper sources.

If by \"information about from where the data comes\" you mean the current \"imported from Wikipedia\" source then: {{support}}.  If you mean the original source that Wikipedia used then: {{oppose}}.  In the latter case, there is no realistic way for a bot to get that information from, for example, a Wikipedia article.  Wikipedia citations might make sense to a human but they are gibberish to a computer.  Take for example a simple birth year on English Wikipedia: this could be listed in the lead, in an infobox, in a category and in the body of the biographical article.  A bot could read the category and could possibly read the infobox.  However, categories are not referenced and it is very rare for an infobox item to be referenced either (usually relying on a citation within the prose).  Of the prose, the lead and the body, either may have a citation but these are usually placed at the end of sentences or paragraphs.  First, it would be hard for a bot to identify the birth year within the rest of the prose, especially within the body (the semi-standard form of the opening sentence of the lead might help it there).  Secondly, even if it could identify the year, a bot could not comprehend the meaning of the citation.  Possibly, if the citation was given directly after the year, a bot could make the direct connection, but this is not done on Wikipedia. Further, Wikivoyage does not use citations; most other Wikimedia projects do not use citations like this either.  I do agree that this can be improved ''later'', by humans, and that specialised bots could provide a better source in some, very specific circumstances. - [[User:AdamBMorgan|AdamBMorgan]] ([[User talk:AdamBMorgan|talk]]) 17:47, 21 August 2013 (UTC)\n{{discussion bottom}}\n\n==What kind of statement doesn't need a source/needs a source ?==\nI think this question becomes more crucial in order to keep a good collaboration among the different contributors.

See for example {{Q|307144}}: As {{P|225}}: ''Ecchlorolestes nylephtha'' is now referenced by a valid third-party source, the source \"imported from en-wp\" is now redundant as the third-party source is both, a validation of the claim and a valid source for it. Of course, a claim which has already a source based on valid reference should not be amended by additional Wikipedia-based {{P|143}} sources, e.g. [//www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q11998&diff=53300426&oldid=51495009].

Example:\n\n*Bear\n:*Bear\n:*Face of bear\n:*Bear cub\n:*Bear eating\n\nThe current approach is to use {{p|18}} for the general image and create special properties for the others. With our example it looks like this:\n\n*Bear\n:*{{p|18}}\n:*Face image\n:*Baby/cub image\n:*Eating image\n\nThe problem is that we need an incredible amount of properties to deal with all the special images that we want to add to items. In my opinion it would be easier to deal with those cases with item-datatype qualifiers (mainly one qualifier). Our example would look like this:\n\n*Bear\n:*{{p|18}}\n::*image depicts = animal\n:*{{p|18}} \n::*image depicts = face\n:*{{p|18}} \n::*image depicts = cub\n:*{{p|18}} \n::*image depicts = eating\n\n=== Spacecraft example ===\nThe {{Q|1231148}} <s>mission</s> spacecraft uses {{P|623}} ([[Wikidata:Properties_for_deletion#crew_photo_.28P623.29|PfD Crew Photo]]) for the image of the crew. This could be also solved like this:\n\n:*image = Soyuz TMA-8 crew.jpg\n::*image depicts = {{Q|345844}}\n\nThis approach would also allow us to add more details of the <s>mission</s> spacecraft.

But with images that have a very distinct role in typical applications - i.e. flags, logos, and so on - I think there should be a separate property. As a rule of thumb: If it tends to have its own parameter in infoboxes today, that is a good indication that it is viewed as special enough to warrant its own property. --[[User:Tobias K.|Tobias K.]] ([[User talk:Tobias K.|talk]]) 21:14, 14 July 2013 (UTC)\n:*In my still very basic understanding of semantic-web, it would increase our semantic approach to define all images with existing items, than to create hundreds of image properties that are not linked to any items (I don't think that property-item-links are a planned feature). \"Depicts =\" would be the equivalent of \"subclass of\"/\"instance of\" for images. I think Commons would have to start organizing their images like that too. It makes sense to repeat this at Wikidata because we are making a curated image choice instead of linking a category or a image search which both don't have good control over which images show up. (See plant cell example) --[[User:Tobias1984|Tobias1984]] ([[User talk:Tobias1984|talk]]) 13:52, 15 July 2013 (UTC)\n::* Your argument is valid from a semantics point of view, but the logical conclusion would be to delete almost all of your properties (e.g. such diverse properties as \"founder\", \"headquarters location\" and \"industry\" could all be replaced by a \"related item\" property with the appropriate term given as a qualifier). A minimalistic approach isn't always a good choice, though. Personally, I think Wikidata should not just try to achieve semantic perfection, that's more a long-term goal and could indeed be served by introducing property-item-links at some point in the future. Right now, we should also consider practical uses of the data and user interface concerns: Wikidata will catch on if it is reasonably easy to understand and use ''and'' serves practical needs. By allowing arbitrary terms as image qualifiers, a contributor would no longer get meaningful suggestions for properties, there would be a larger risk of inconsistent usage of terms - made worse by a lack of validation - and this in turn might lead to a less reliable coverage of image types that are actually useful for many applications. --[[User:Tobias K.|Tobias K.]] ([[User talk:Tobias K.|talk]]) 00:10, 26 July 2013 (UTC)\n*<strike>{{comment}}Change from \"image depicts\" to \"description\", with multilingual datatype,  and I would support this.

This is a start with a relatively small question, and should be extended with questions about {{P|279}}. \n\n== Introduction ==\n\nThere is a lot of discussions and misconceptions, and open discussions around [[help:Basic membership properties]]. Their place on Wikidata also has not been discussed on this RfC space, I think we should do that one way or another as it's a very important point.\n\n== Purposes ==\n\n{{P|31}} and {{P|279}} are documented and commonly used here. These properties or equivalent of it exists in a wide variety of systems eg:\n* Semantic web standards: rdf:type ({{P|31}}), rdfs:subClassOf ({{P|279}})\n* Thesauri: skos:broader. Has been refined to 3 varieties in ISO 25964: iso-thes:broaderGeneric ({{P|279}}), iso-thes:broaderInstantial ({{P|31}}), iso-thes:broaderPartitive.\n\nThey are slowly gaining popularity on Wikidata. The main goal of the RfC is to define 1) a notation to define a class of things, and 2) to clarify what bot and humans should expect if an <item> is an instance of a <class item>.\n\n== An example ==\nWe'll start with a small example of a well-defined class in Wikidata: [[Help:sources|books and editions]].\n\n=== The ''Book'' class ===\nWe (probably) all have (physical) books in our libraries. These books are prints of a creative work written by an author. There is a ''Book class item'' in Wikidata is {{Q|571}} and one of its instances is {{Q|Q4795}}.\n\n\n==== Classes and instances ====\nLet's stop here.  I'll propose that we use a textual notation of the [[:en:Web_Ontology_Language|Web Ontology Language]] -- commonly known as OWL.  The notation is similar to OWL's [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/ Manchester syntax], which makes OWL easy for humans to read and write:\n{{div col||30em}}\n\n<div style=\"display:inline-block; width : 100%;\">\n===== The book class =====\n   Class: Book\n   \n   Individual {{Q|Q4795}}: \n     Types: Book\n\n</div>\n\n<br/>\n\n<div style=\"display:inline-block; width : 100%;\">\n\n===== Explanations =====\n \n; <code>Class</code> \n: keyword used to define a class. Anything that is displayed indented below is the definition of characteristics of this class. A class is a type of item which refers to a group of instances\n; <code>Individual</code> \n: keyword used to describe an individual instance or thing or object. This could be linked to the Class using the {{P|31}} property or it's sub-properties.\n; <code>Types</code> \n: keyword used indented below <code>individual</code>, used to define a list of classes (comma separated) which the item is an instance of. Should be linked to the class using the 'Subclass of' property.\n\n</div>\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{Comment|Note}} In this notation, class and instance are not properties like in Wikidata, but are the basics concepts of the notation and of the classification, so they are not expressed as properties but are directly expressed into the grammar.\n\n==== Properties ====\nNow we know that a particular literary work has an author. This can be made in Manchester syntax by saying that the ''author'' property applies to ''Book class'' instances, and is noted:\n\n{{Div col||30em}}\n\n<div style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\">\n=====Notation=====\n   Object property: {{P|50}}\n      Domain: {{Q|571}}\n   Object property: {{P|P1476}}\n      Domain: {{Q|571}}\n</div>\n\n\n<div style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%\">\n\n===== Explanations =====\n; <code>Object Property</code> \n: keyword used to define caracteristics of a property whose value is an item (<code>Datatype property</code> is used for properties whose value is a Wikidata type.  See [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#Property OWL documentation] for more.)\n; <code>Domain</code> \n: keyword used to define on which item this property should be used. These items should be instances of one of the classes listed after the keyword.\n</div>\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===== An instance in Manchester Syntax =====\nWe have defined a class, and we have said that the author property applied to instances of that class. we then can extend our previous model\n   Individual {{Q|Q4795}} : \n     Types: {{Q|571}}      \n     Facts: {{P|50}} {{Q|4731}}\n; <code>Facts</code>\n: keyword equivalent to ''Claims'' in Wikidata, followed by a list of ''Property/value''.\n\n=== Towards a class/instance relationship definition ===\n\nThese proposed textual notations are using an implicit ''Class/instance'' relationship definition. The main proposal is to link the expected properties on an item to the class of the item, based on an already existing language, and to be an introduction to this notation to Wikidata community to get comments on whether or not this is a good start - this is why there is a lot of untreated things here.\n\nBy browsing Wikidata task forces/project page, we can see that there is already things that can fit in in pages such as [[Help:sources]] or [[Wikidata:Chemistry_task_force/Properties]], but things are presented differently, and properties are not always liked to a ''class''. A common language could help, it is also bot readable, so if we happen to do that we could build easily bot which can do generic bots consistency checks with respect to our notations (more to follow as we extend the notation) and which will report if they see claims that do not fit in our current model. Then we could see what we could do with these claims. It also seems to me pretty human readable.\n\nOne other advantage : discussions on property proposals are sometimes tedious, with this we could adopt a whole domain specific model at once without voting for all and every properties.\n\nIf there is only one thing to get from the RfC, it's the idea associated to the ''Domain'' keyword which I did not actually explicitly saw in Wikidata very often. \n\n\n=== Propositions of this RfC ===\n# Adopt (in principle, there is other things to discuss) this partial definition for of expected properties in a class/instance relationships formalisation (even if you do not like the notation)\n# using the proposed notation as a base to define, discuss and document classes, and to show example instances.\n#: This would have many advantages : unify notations, ease writing of consitency check for bots, writing documentation page related to how we do things on Wikidata in a consistent and standardised ways, building interfaces easily by proposing a model and build a javascript interface from this model, be compatible with other already existing tools ...\n# later extend this system to adopt other aspects of the Manchester syntax.\n\n=== A question currently opened in Wikidata (out of scope) ===\n{{comment|this point is worth mentioning but is supposed to be discussed in another subsequent RfC. Please just comment the modeling and ''instance creation'' process.}} \nAn ongoing discussion on [[Help talk:Basic membership properties]] is on the nature of instances. {{U|Emw}} argues that in the web semantic World, an instance can only be a physical object, and classes are sets of physical objects. In our example this would imply that our Book is not a book, it is a class, and its instances would be one of the physical objects in libraries.\n: But the text in a book has a single copyright so the text of a book can be an {{P|31}} a novel or a play, a textbook etc.\n: Remember that the wikipedia article is not about any individual physical copy of the book. It is about the text, the content, common to all the various physical books.\n: There are a few articles which are about particular copies of a book, such as {{Q|1885752}}, and these are {{P|31}} book. [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 15:51, 24 July 2013 (UTC)\n:: Yeah, it's a problem we have to address, we should not have this kind of ambiguities. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]]) 16:19, 24 July 2013 (UTC)\n::: I don't think there is any ambiguity. A brief glance at any of the linked wikipedia articles is enough to tell if a Wikidata item refers to an individual copy of a book or to the content of a book.  I can conceive of a case where there is only one copy of a book so the wikipedia article is about both the physical book and about it's content but even in that case I am sure it would be clear that the Wikidata item refers to both of these concepts. i doubt there would be ambiguity.

Should we rather say it is an individual novel? [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 22:12, 25 July 2013 (UTC)\n\n:{{Q|4795}} is not an individual book. It is thousands of physical paper books. Those books have a printer, not an author. It is however an individual novel and the novel has an author. [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 21:53, 25 July 2013 (UTC)\n:: I took a real model to make my example, this is the way it's currently say to model into Wikidata in [[Help:sources]]. It's probably not perfect, but it's not what we should discuss for now :).\n:::Not perfect is an understatement. Altogether ambiguous would be better. An individual physical copy of a book on a shelf is an instance of the particular printing & distribution format, designated by a specific ISBN --different for paper, hardcover, etc.; which is in turn an instance of the particular edition (2nd, 3rd, etc.) designated by a separate LCCN and OCLC number, which in turn is a particular version (print,  recording ), with a standardized material-type designator,  of a version ( in a particular language of  a Work (with a standardized Uniform Title), .  These are all separate levels, and the degree to which they need to be specified varies.  (For illustration, an example of a Work is Aristotle's ''Poetics''. The version in Project Gutenberg is an English translation by Butcher, edition (as usual with them) unspecified, but probably  1895, in a transcription by An Anonymous Volunteer, and David Widger,  The actual text of the Gutenberg edition is yet another problem, because it is subject to continuous updating.  [[Special:Contributions/108.27.99.125|108.27.99.125]] 21:04, 2 August 2013 (UTC)\n:Take this example [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Peter_Rabbit The Tale of Peter Rabbit]. The article discusses, or could potentially discuss, an '''instance of''' a creative work (specifically the original book written with the author's hand), '''subclasses of''' the original work (the derivative works in other languages, editions), and '''instances of''' the work (each printed copy created by the printer), any printed instance of a book can become notable (e.g. one copy which was signed by Beatrix Potter, and sold for a lot of money). I think the root of problems lies with basing a database around wikipedia articles, in some cases it gets messy. For example, many school related articles generally describe both a building and an organization.  Should these not be at least 2 separate items?

I'm sorry if I seem negative above but I worry that this proposal is a bit divorced from the practicalities of how wikidata works. Where there is a difference it may well be appropriate to change the wikidata practice to better align with semantic web customs but these changes need to be spelled out.\n:::: No problem, it's a work in progress we are building together (and it's not for nothing I asked a ''is it clear enough'' question /o\\)\n::::: I don't think we should modify Manchester syntax.  There's an impedance between Manchester syntax and our in-house vocabulary, but the benefits of adhering to the standard Manchester syntax are greater than then costs of tailoring it to align with our in-house vocabulary.  The benefit of using a standard is that it's the same across projects, and has tutorials, usage examples, solutions for common problems etc. available across the web.  The syntax itself requires a degree of effort to learn, and adding a tiny bit more effort to map our vocabulary to the standard seems reasonable. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 01:43, 29 July 2013 (UTC)\n::: Personally I think the concept of 'class' will become important in stage 3 - queries - and it probably does make sense to codify what a class is now however you have not made the case for doing this in your writeup above. I hope I can help draft this. [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 22:02, 25 July 2013 (UTC)\n:::: It's already important, it's an implicit part of what we are doing, we are defining class all other the project informally, without saying it always explicitely, which tend to make the retrieving of information possible for a human, but tedious. I propose to make this a little more explicit here. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]]) 10:48, 26 July 2013 (UTC)\n<span id=\"Comment_from_Markus\"></span>\n{{comment}} (Please feel free to move this comment to any applicable section if another one fits better.) I feel obliged to comment on this, given that I have co-developed (1) the Wikidata datamodel, (2) the OWL ontology language, and (3) the main tool currently used to translate one into the other. ;-)\n\nFirst, I must say that I do not fully understand the proposal. When you propose to \"use\" Manchester syntax (or something very similar), where do you expect this to be used? By users editing Wikidata in string-type property values? That seems to be a bit cumbersome and not very user-friendly. Frankly I don't think this has any chance of adoption (this seems to be the point made in some comments above already). Also from a technical perspective, it needs some work to do a proper syntax check on such free-text inputs, and of course one would want auto completion and similar features too; without all this working very well, any free-text input will lead to many errors/typos. So I am sceptical that this form of UI could work in Wikidata, even if we accept that Manchester Syntax is easy for (\"normal\") people to use.\n\nSecond, there is a deeper semantic question. I am happy with OWL-style \"instance of\". It is well understood and agrees with what most languages that support classification do (essentially it just means: \"every class denotes a set of things; every entity denotes an element; an entity E ''is an instance'' of a class C, if the element that E denotes is contained in the set that C denotes\"). I think most people would agree with this notion. Now OWL does not apply directly to Wikidata (since Wikidata encodes information in a form that is not the same as OWL; we can translate it but in more than one way), so one needs to be more clear what we mean here by applying OWL axioms on Wikidata. However, I am sure that this can be done, as long as the axioms we use are only the simple ones in this RfC.\n\nNote that the original data model of Wikidata contains special statement types for instance of and subclass of (rather than leaving it to the community to create properties called like this). These would have been the Wikidata representation of what you suggest here, I think. To my regret, these features were dropped due to lack of resources for implementing them. The current solution where we use two properties to capture this information may work just as well (if stable), but we need to ask what it means for instance of/subclass of to have qualifiers. This is something that cannot happen when using OWL, and it is not immediate what this means (this would need another discussion to solve; I just point it out here). This is also a reason why the RDF export script does not export instance of/subclass of using special OWL constructs.\n\nFinally, regarding the distinction of classes: I don't think that it is necessary to have a special way to mark things that are a class. In general, we can consider something to be a class if it is used like one (that is: as the value of a subclass/instance property). Even in OWL, we do not require classes to be distinguished from individuals. The semantic solution to this (avoiding Russel's paradox) is to say that every entity can be considered as a class that denotes a set (which may contain other elements) and also as an individual that denotes an element (that could be contained in some class); we do not say that this rather unspecified \"element\" ''is'' the set. So if I would say in OWL that \"Class A is an instance of class A\" this means \"The element denoted by class A is contained in the set denoted by class A\". In particular, I don't claim that class A denotes a set which contains itself. OWL 2 still requires classes to be declared to help parsing, but one can always tell from the context if an entity is used \"as a class\" or \"as an individual\", so this is not really essential. I think that a similar approach could work for Wikidata. Of course, it would still be useful to have services that display, say, a class hierarchy based on Wikidata's subclass of, but this does not require a special class declaration.\n\n--[[User:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch]] ([[User talk:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 18:20, 20 September 2013 (UTC)\n: Thanks for your comment Markus.  It's very helpful to have input from experts on things like this.  Replying to a few of your points:\n::* \"<i>First, I must say that I do not fully understand the proposal. When you propose to \"use\" Manchester syntax (or something very similar), where do you expect this to be used?</i>\"\n::: Mostly in Talk pages and the 'Wikidata' namespace.  The '[[Wikidata:Requests_for_comment/Typing_:_class_\u21c4_instance_relationship_in_Wikidata#Propositions of this RfC|Propositions of this RFC]]' section outlines things in a bit more detail.  I don't think anyone is proposing we scrap the current UI of the Q (item) namespace and require human end-users to navigate through Manchester syntax to read and write claims.  The goal is to agree upon a format for discussing data models.  In suggesting we strictly adhere to Manchester syntax and not come up with a home-brew Wikidata syntax, my goal is to reduce friction between Wikidata and people from the rest of the Semantic Web who might want to talk about our data models.\n::* \"<i>we need to ask what it means for instance of/subclass of to have qualifiers.  This is something that cannot happen when using OWL...</i>\"\n::: I think [[P:P31|instance of]] and [[P:P279|subclass of]] having qualifiers means the same thing as other properties having qualifiers.  'instance of' and 'subclass of' are \"properties\" in Wikidata and, as stated in [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_type rdf:type] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof rdfs:subClassOf], RDF/RDFS -- and thus OWL.  So if it isn't possible to have qualifiers on instance of/subclass of in OWL, then how is it possible to have qualifiers on other properties?\n:::: ''Reply:'' RDF, RDFS, and OWL do not have any notion of \"qualifier\". So if we say that it is \"the same thing as other properties having qualifiers\" we still have not explained what we mean by this. One can model qualifiers in RDF and OWL using reification (not necessarily using the RDF reification vocabulary), quads, or named graphs (there is discussion on this elsewhere). Our current approach uses a form of reification. This involves replacing the Wikidata property by several other properties of related URIs. However, there is only one \"instance of\", so it is not clear how this replacement would be compatible with this. --[[User:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch]] ([[User talk:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 17:27, 8 October 2013 (UTC)\n::* \"<i>Finally, regarding the distinction of classes: I don't think that it is necessary to have a special way to mark things that are a class</i>\"\n::: I disagree.  This seems to imply that Wikidata should delete 'subclass of' and rename 'instance of' to 'is a'.  Without two different properties, how can it be determined whether an item at the bottom of a type hierarchy is an instance or a class?  \n::: For example, consider {{Q|556}}.  Assume that item is not the value of any 'is a' claims, but it has an 'is a' {{Q|11344}} claim.  So hydrogen is an element.  However, because hydrogen represents the type of many individual things (i.e., individual hydrogen atoms), it is a class, not an instance.  By collapsing 'instance of' and 'subclass of' into 'is a', there's no way to specify that important fact about {{Q|556}}.  This use case applies to many items on Wikidata.\n:::: No. An item can have two semantics : hydrogen is a chemical element. It means that evety atoms can be either hydrogen or not, ie. they belongs to the set of this type of chemical elements or not. In this view we must use ''instance of'' to classify a particular atom in the set of hydrogen elements. Over view : hydrogen is a concept used by humans to classify atoms. In this view hydrogen is an instance of ''concepts used by humans to classify atoms''. But what is the set of hydrogens atoms to the set of all atoms ? it is sure that an instance of hydrogen is also an instance of atom. So hydrogen is also a subclass of atoms ... The keypoint is that the ''instance of'' an ''instance of'' something has no (universal) meaning. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 09:46, 6 October 2013 (UTC)\n\n:::: ''Reply:'' TomTOM is right. \"Subclass of\" and \"instance of\" describe different relationships, and we need to distinguish these. I was not suggesting to blur this, and indeed \"is a\" is notorious for causing this confusion (hence should be avoided). What I meant is that we do not need to use different entities for classes and individuals, since it is clear from the context what we mean. For a detailed discussion of this and related issues, I recommend Motik's 2007 paper [http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/4/617 On the Properties of Metamodeling in OWL]. --[[User:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch]] ([[User talk:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 17:27, 8 October 2013 (UTC)\n::* \"<i>Even in OWL, we do not require classes to be distinguished from individuals.</i>\"\n::: To my understanding of the W3C recommendation's description of [http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/#s1.3 the three sublanguages of OWL], that's true in OWL Full but not OWL DL.  This is actually the only example the recommendation gives for how OWL DL is different than OWL Full: it says that in OWL DL \"while a class may be a subclass of many classes, a class cannot be an instance of another class\".  Since the recommendation implies that OWL Full is neither computationally complete nor decidable, it seems to me that metamodeling is not an option if we want Wikidata to be usable with semantic reasoning software.\n::: Of the freely licensed semantic reasoners listed in [[:en:Semantic_reasoner|Semantic reasoner]], do any support metamodeling?\n:::: ''Reply:'' You are referring to an outdated version of the standard here. Meta-modelling capabilities have been improved in the [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/ current version of OWL], which is the recommendation since 2009. There is also a paragraph on this in the [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#Simple_metamodeling_capabilities new features document].

[[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|talk]]) 21:53, 25 July 2013 (UTC)\n::: I don't think we should modify Manchester syntax.  The benefit of using an effective standard like Manchester syntax is that the terminology of the syntax itself is the same across projects -- whether it be Wikidata or some other Semantic Web project.  And for better or worse, I think it's very unlikely that the community will agree to change 'item' references to say 'object'.  This implies some impedance between Manchester syntax and our vocabulary, but I think it would be better to educate contributors about Manchester syntax than to tailor the syntax itself to align with our in-house vocabulary. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 01:33, 29 July 2013 (UTC)\n:::: I don't think this is a real problem, if this is just a keyword substitution it's trivial, and as Wikidata is an important project other Web semantic projects could even implement Wikidata syntax. There is one thing I don't know how to handle yet for examples : qualifiers. It seems impossible to adopt a syntax in Wikidata as is if it's not possible to easily take qualifiers into account, so we might have to make our own extension. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]]) 16:38, 29 July 2013 (UTC)\n::::: I think it would be a problem.  I look at it this way: if contributors are interested in data modeling, then they will eventually need to get acquainted with the syntaxes used to express RDF and OWL.  Wikidata developers have committed to exporting data in RDF/XML, which is a W3C standard.  Such built-in support for OWL isn't likely in the near future, but nevertheless our data modeling efforts would be best served by being expressible as OWL.  Basing our syntax strictly off Manchester syntax would allow us to export our OWL data models as RDF/XML files.  \n::::: Using a tailor-made Wikidata syntax different from Manchester syntax would increase friction between Wikidata and the Semantic Web on multiple levels.  First, it would require an in-house program that converts between our home-brew Wikidata syntax and the standard formats.  Second, it would make it more difficult for Wikidata contributors to find relevant data modeling examples, existing bodies of Q&A, and other resources from the wider Semantic Web, and make it more difficult for contributors from the wider Semantic Web (which uses Manchester syntax) to determine what our data models mean in a language the external world understands.  \n::::: The bigger problem, though, is statements like \"other Semantic Web projects could even implement Wikidata syntax\".  Wikidata is an important project but there are plenty of other important Semantic Web projects, for example [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/ ChEBI], the [http://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ NCI Thesaurus], [http://www.umbel.org/ UMBEL], [http://www.ontologyportal.org/ SUMO], etc.  They all communicate with standard OWL formats.  Tailoring the Manchester syntax itself to our in-house vocabulary goes against the grain of the Semantic Web, and would make us less interoperable with the outside world. \n::::: So I don't think trivial word substitutions like 'Individual' -> 'Instance', 'Type' -> 'Subclass', 'Object property' -> 'Instance property' would be a good idea.  That said, I think qualifiers might be something that we need to consider extending Manchester syntax for -- but only if there's no way to support qualifiers with standard Manchester syntax.  I'd be interested to know how qualifiers will be exported to RDF/XML -- that should indicate how to express qualifiers in Manchester syntax. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 03:18, 31 July 2013 (UTC)\n::::::You're talking of Wikidata's user versus Web semantic professionals. I think it's best to have a model which maps better Wikidata concepts to help Wikidata user and let semantic Web pros manage the complexity of discrepancy beetween both models. I think you did not realize that syntax is probably the least of their concerns, standardized or not. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]]) 08:58, 31 July 2013 (UTC)\n::::: @EmW to aswer your question about how Wikidata model is translated into Semantic Web standards, see [http://semanticweb.org/RDF/Wikidata/wikidata-ontology-20130801.owl the ontology of the RDF export]. To express qualification, statement are reified (that is there is an ''item'' for each statement) and triples are created using this reified statement to qualify or source it. I don't think it's a good idea to follow this path as it's quite different from Wikidata model. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]]) 13:02, 10 August 2013 (UTC)\n; comments on the purposes and objectives\n:Why do we need a formal language for defining classes when, till now, Wikidata has managed almost without a 'class' concept?\n:: till now, Wikidata has done consistency check with something like 'if there is this property, then there should also be this property', and on constraints on what an item value of a property should countains. This is ad-oc type checking and kind of weak, I don't know if as for now we can say something like ''the value item should be of that type''. Another problem in my mind is that the information is distributed in constraints in discussion pages of properties, and is tedious to check by itself. A formal model could compress this information on a project and a lot of domain specific models, be consistently presented and beeing a lot faster to get for a human. One other point, there is tools from the semantic web world who already exists to do things, getting closer to them could open a door for writing consistency checking bots far more advanced than what we have now. And last : I just presented a small part of manchester syntax. There is other good things and knowledge encoded in this syntax and the tool associated we will not have to discover the hard way by making our own mistakes if we take it as a support. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]]) 10:10, 26 July 2013 (UTC)\n:: One other thing : it has been asked for. When I talked about [[Help:modeling]] on Chemistry project, where they were building a model about biological chemistry and asked if someone could move it on [[Help:modeling]] when this would be done, someone replied ''Good idea, is there some kind of formal language ?''. I thought before that I would rely on examples as it would be easier to understand as a start. {{U|Emw}} has been an advocate of this from the start. There is also a lot of confusion on discussions, there is comment like ''This sounds complicated but interesting, where can I read about that'' in project chat. An unambiguous and always the same language to discuss should help, associated with a detailed and good Help page. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]]) 10:29, 26 July 2013 (UTC)\n::: I strongly agree that classes are a useful thing to have. The observation that we do not (strongly) use a certain feature (yet) is hardly an argument against it, given that Wikidata is still in its early days. On the other hand, whoever posted this is right that we need to provide clear motives for all extensions. For me, the main reason for a class hierarchy is to reduce redundancy in the data (and thus errors and maintenance effort). \"Instance of\" has clearly a very important role since the decision to remove \"main type (GND)\". \"Subclass of\" can be used to avoid having to state \"instance of\" for all applicable classes if most of them are just more general than the ones that we already have (e.g., if we know that something is a \"solar planet\", we do not need to state that it is a \"planet\"). However, while these basic features are useful (and well used already), it needs more motivation indeed why we need a special input method for this. --[[User:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch]] ([[User talk:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 18:29, 20 September 2013 (UTC)\n\n====Confusing====\nI find this distinction (or lack therof) between {{P|31}} and {{P|279}} really confusing.

On a deeper level, since the definition of {{Q|215627}} is so ambiguous, I think it would be better to use a more precisely defined concept, e.g. simply {{Q|5}}.  Yes, there are ambiguities in precisely what defines \"human\" (see [[:en:Species_problem|species problem]]), but I think ambiguous instances of human are far rarer than ambiguous instances of person.

What do you mean -- that the intrinsic definition of human varies for subjects alive 10,000+ years ago and those alive today?  I'm also not quite sure what you mean by \"(the definition of species) is not stable across speciation\".  Please clarify.  I'm familiar with the concept of speciation.\n::::::: I feel like an important point is being missed here.  As I mentioned before, the [[:en:Species problem|species problem]] means there is some ambiguity in definition of species, though this doesn't affect humans much.  That said -- and this is the important part -- the definition of {{Q|215627}} is immensely more ambiguous than the definition of {{Q|5}}.  The definition of {{Q|215627}} is a matter of philosophy and law, and is a topic of significant controversy in those domains.  The definition of {{Q|5}}, on the other hand, is a matter of science and enjoys effective consensus.  The definition of 'human' is not nebulous and politicized; the definition of 'person' very much is.  \n::::::: As I've said, using {{P|31}} {{Q|5}} for items like {{Q|45661}} doesn't imply {{Q|5}} {{P|279}} {{Q|215627}}.  The latter claim is independent of the former, though the latter claim is probably valid.  On the other hand {{P|31}} {{Q|14870023}} implies there are valid subjects for the claim {{P|31}} {{Q|14896454}}, which is obviously problematic.  Why do we need to couple our classifications to the controversial, ill-defined definition of 'person'?  Let's avoid the philosophical briar patch that leads to and use the uncontroversial (but still very useful) claim {{P|31}} {{Q|5}} as our initial P107 'person' mapping for Coco Chanel et al.

It was sort of discussed above but I think we should focus the discussion that more clearly in a separate section. \n* {{Q|5}} (alias: ''Homo sapiens'')\n** sounds like the most factual and neutral item to me; The only potential reason I see against it are that some people (languages ? / cultures? ) may find it weird or unpleasant to see humans classified by a taxonomic term. Maybe we should do an informal cross-language survey first,so that we do not have to fix everything afterwards (like we had for male/female in [[P:P21]]) -[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 07:14, 13 September 2013 (UTC)\n**:I would definitely check to see what the labels are for the other languages. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 16:30, 13 September 2013 (UTC)\n**: Note that [[Q5]] is labeled 'human', not 'Homo sapiens'.  (The latter is an alias.)  The item is certainly concerned with the subject as a taxonomic entity, but the label 'human' is not nearly as formal as 'Homo sapiens'.  'Human' -- just 'human' -- captures in common language that more neutral and uncontroversial (if not also plainly more useful) concept than any label containing the word 'person'. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 04:03, 17 September 2013 (UTC)\n**::Only in English. That's the concern he's voicing. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 00:09, 18 September 2013 (UTC)\n::::: I think it's plausible that opinions vary on the \"weirdness\" of classifying all items like Coco Chanel as {{P|31}} {{Q|5}} as much among English speakers as they do between English speakers and speakers of other languages.  In fact, I would be surprised if most people -- whatever their language -- didn't consider it a bit weird to directly classify Coco Chanel as a human instead of a person.  In languages that make the distinction, \"Coco Chanel is a person\" is probably a more colloquial way express the concept captured by the more precise statement \"Coco Chanel is a human\".  \n::::: However, P31 is for specifying the class of an instance in a hierarchy of all human knowledge.  The idea is that we can use P31 to infer properties about an instance by examining the properties of its class.  Classes from [[:en:Folk_taxonomy|folk taxonomies]] -- like the class indicated by colloquial usages of 'person' -- are useful only in an informal, very domain-specific scope.  That makes vernacular classes like 'person' bad fits as values for a property that can be used for generic type inference.  What are the properties of {{Q|215627}}?  That item currently has mappings to other classification/categorization systems and says 'person' is a subclass of 'subject' -- none of that directly tells us much useful information about 'person'.  Nailing more specific properties down simultaneously makes 'person' better defined and better suited as a P31 value on the one hand, while on the other hand making it more \"weird\" and philosophically vexing than tacitly understood.  \n::::: As I stress in the [[Wikidata:Migrating_away_from_GND_main_type#P31_value_for_things_like_Coco_Chanel|Coco Chanel discussion]] above, the properties that define {{Q|215627}} are very nebulous and philosophically thorny, while the properties that define {{Q|5}} enjoy much more consensus and much less thorniness.  That holds in English, and likely in most other languages.  I just examined non-English articles on [[:en:Human|human]] sitelinked for [[:ar:%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86|Arabic]], [[:ca:Hum%C3%A0|Catalan]], [[:zh:%E4%BA%BA|Chinese]], [[:fa:%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86|Farsi]], [[:fr:Homo_sapiens|French]], [[:de:Mensch|German]], [[:ha:Yan-adam|Hausa]], [[:he:%D7%90%D7%93%D7%9D|Hebrew]], [[:it:Homo_sapiens|Italian]], [[:ja:%E3%83%92%E3%83%88|Japanese]], [[:pt:Homo_sapiens|Portuguese]], [[:ru:%D0%A7%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9|Russian]], [[:so:Biniaadan|Somali]], [[:es:Homo_sapiens|Spanish]], [[:sw:Binadamu|Swahili]] and [[:vi:Lo%C3%A0i_ng%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Di|Vietnamese]], and except Hausa and Somali, they all have a infobox that represents taxonomic data for ''Homo sapiens''.  (Somali seems to discuss \"human\" as a taxonomic entity, though I can't make out fine detail.)  The subject of English and Non-English Wikipedia articles for [[:en:Person|person]], however, seem much less ontologized.  I saw no infoboxes, some 'person' articles were merely disambiguation pages, etc.  I suspect the 'person' articles that do exist are similar to the English Wikipedia article, where the gist is that person is a philosophical and legal concept about which there is little agreement on a definition. \n::::: If it's true that 'human' is so much more precisely and uncontroversially defined than 'person' in not only English but also other languages -- as I think there is increasing evidence to indicate -- then I think the arguments remain strong against directly tying 'person' -- or 'human person', or any other class that has a strong, direct tie to 'person' -- to our P31 values for all items like Coco Chanel.

Like it or not, there are quite a few items about fictional characters, and that is something that we need to check for many queries. How do we make a list of aviators that excludes fictional aviators  ? Find items with {{P|106}}: {{Q|2095549}} that are instances of Homo Sapiens, or find items with {{P|106}}: {{Q|2095549}} that are non-fictional ? The latter seems much more natural to me. And it makes it ''much'' more straightforward to indicate that Han Solo is a fictional human while Mickey Mouse a fictional mouse.--[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|talk]]) 06:37, 8 September 2013 (UTC)\n\n: In the same discussions I said that IMHO \"is fictional\" is not sufficient: if we defined (some) fictional characters as humans, in a query ''people born in United Kingdom in 1980'' I will find also Harry Potter! Once defined fictional characters as {{Q|Q95074}} we will exclude them automatically from queries concerning \"real people\". We will define the \"specie\" of fictional character with a new property that will tell us that the fictional character Mickey Mouse is a mouse and Han Solo is a human.\n:Thank you for your comment: my and your are two different ways to solve this problem. I hope that other people write here their suggestions. --[[User:Paperoastro|Paperoastro]] ([[User talk:Paperoastro|talk]]) 13:10, 8 September 2013 (UTC)\n::You would have to add to the condition \"is fictional != true\" to the query. In this case that would indeed require an additional condition. In others, like my aviator example, that would just replace \"instance of human\". What I meant with my example is that anyway, we almost always need to check that someone is not fictional. It can be done either by  \"instance of: homo sapiens\" or \"is fictional != true\". I think the latter is clearer, but I might former is indeed sometimes more concise, and If every fictional thing was a fictional human, I might support it. But there is such a thing as the '''Mickey Mouse problem'''. You suggest that there should be a separate\"species\" property. Yes, that may work, but I see two problems with that:\n::* if there is a separate \"species\" property, I find it strange to use P31 to say that people are instances of homo sapiens. \n::* more importantly fictional things are not always people. What would you do with {{Q|19852}} ? Probably something like; \"instance of fictional object + type of object: ring\". That means that we need several rather arbitrary properties like \"species\", \"type of object\", \"type of place\" etc. For real objects, there seems to be a growing  consensus for using \"instance of\" rather than these special properties. It means that the \"type of object\" property should be narrowed to \"type of fictional object\". Fictional items would thus a different structure than normal items, and I really find that confusing.\n:: --[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|talk]]) 14:04, 8 September 2013 (UTC)\n:::: If users query \"people born in United Kingdom in 1980\" and get back {{Q|3244512}} among the results, then Wikidata is doomed.  Requiring users to add a clause \"WHERE 'is fictional' != true\" is also unacceptable; it would be an egregious API and command-line UI flaw.  Wikidata should be unabashedly biased to the natural world.  While it's important to be able to account for fictional entities in our structured data, solutions that make structured data for non-fictional entities unwieldy or notably less easy to use should be considered non-starters.  If this makes structured data for fictional entities cumbersome, then I think that's OK.\n:::: There have been several discussions about how to handle fictional entities: see e.g. [[Wikidata:Project_chat/Archive/2013/05#Fictional_stuff|Fictional stuff]].  Lydia, a proxy for the Wikidata developers, has also commented on this:\n::::: {{quote|There will not be such a datatype. It is better to express these with things like \"is instance of:fictional person\" for example|[[User:Lydia_Pintscher_(WMDE)|Lydia Pintscher (WMDE)]], regarding the [[Wikidata:Contact_the_development_team/Archive/2013/05#Boolean_datatype_.3F|boolean datatype]] necessary for an \"is fictional\" property}}\n:::: So the WMDE spokesperson and a large set of Wikidata contributors who have commented on how to deal with fictional entities have proposed using \"{{P|31}} fictional ''x''\" to solve this issue.  Will this create a large number of arbitrary \"fictional ''x''\" items?  Yes.  But that seems like a much better solution than polluting non-fictional items with crufty qualifier claims like \"is fictional = false\" and requiring future query users to tack on boilerplate code to filter out imaginary people from real ones. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 16:07, 8 September 2013 (UTC)\n:::::Yes, there has been various conversations beforehand, but no consensus and that seems relevant here. I fully agree that having to use \"is fictional\" is a bit unwieldy, but does that does not really make things much better to use \"instance of human\". Say you want a list of Japanese nobel prize winners. If you use the \"is fictional solution\", you need to add \"is fictional != true, and if you use the \"instance of human\" solution, you need to add \"instance of: human\". I do not think that is much better. The only way to filter out imaginary people without any boilerplate is to create a \"fictional\" counterpart to all properties, so that fictional people have \"fictional nationalities\" and earn \"fictional prizes\". Is that what you are suggesting ? --[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|talk]]) 18:33, 8 September 2013 (UTC)\n:::::More precisely, I see two cases: \n:::::* when the query could apply to non-humans, like in \"born in the United Kingdom in 1980.\" That query could very well apply to horse, so if you want to restrict it to real human, you need to specify that. In this case, that makes two parameters for \"is fictional\" instead of one for \"instance of real human\". \n:::::*when queried properties normally apply to humans. If you look for people with a nobel prize, you will not come across horse. In this case, you need the same number of paramters for the \"is fictional\" and the \"real human\" solution. And there may be complications. It may happen that some loony Emperor names his horse Senator. There is no reason to exclude him of the list of senator but the \"instance of real human\" thing makes it tricky. Of course, this is not a very common case, but I think that shows how \"instance of real human\" is more brittle than neatly distinguishing \"humanness\" from fictionality. If you add that all the problems it will create for fictional items, I think it amply makes the case against the \"is real human\" solution. --[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|talk]]) 20:00, 8 September 2013 (UTC)\n{{od}}\nWe have two options for specifying the class of fictional instances:  \n# put a Boolean \"is fictional\" qualifier on ''all'' P31 claims, or\n# prepend \"fictional\" on ''only'' P31 values for fictional items.  \nOption 2 is better.  Both involve adding boilerplate code, but Option 2 entails drastically less boilerplate code.  I assert that Wikidata should be biased to reality, thus Option 2 should be preferred, since Option 1 makes it more cumbersome to deal with subjects in the natural world.\n\nRegarding your example, noone is concerned that the query \"born in the United Kingdom in 1980\" could return a horse.  It will not flabbergast users that such a query could return an item about a horse it satisfies the condition \"born in the United Kingdom in 1980\".  The query under discussion is different.  It's \"person in the United Kingdom in 1980\".  Having Harry Potter among the results of such a query will flabbergast and frustrate users and cause them to ignore Wikidata.  Requiring users to specify the query in the form \"non-fictional person born in the United Kingdom in 1980\" is bad user interface design.  By default, queries should return only non-fictional results.\n\nThis requires having more items -- \"fictional person\", \"fictional prize\", etc.  That's fine because building type hierarchies for fictional universes is an edge case.  Sure, Trekkies will be annoyed that they have to add boilerplate code to support querying knowledge about what class of starship the Enterprise is and what type of organism Admiral Ackbar is, but such is life.  The demographer wanting an easy and accurate way to determine how many people were born in the United Kingdom in 1980 will thank us.  So will the physician wanting to easily and accurate way to find out if their patient's version of a gene has been found in any other humans.\n\nFurthermore, per the quote above, there will be no Boolean datatype for an \"is fictional\" property.  If we want to go against WMDE advice and implement a Boolean datatype ourselves, we'll have to use enforce value constraints via bot.  That, of course, would be quite the kludge. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 22:50, 8 September 2013 (UTC)\n:I am not sure I understand you point. Eliminating boilerplate would not require more items, it would require a full set of parallel properties. Unless we have a \"fictional birth date\" property, \"born in 1980\" will return fictional people as well as real people and real horses. And with \"instance of real human\", it would be rather difficult to get a list containing real people and real horses, but excluding fictional humans. \n:There will be no boolean datatype, and it would be better to have have, but I do not think the development team has any deep objection to it, they just have a tight schedule. It would be better to have one, but the item datatype would work all right. We can decide that is is set to False by default, and bots already make constraint checkings on a massive scale anyway. --[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|talk]]) 06:23, 9 September 2013 (UTC)\n:: Absolutely not, we can reuse the property ''birth date'', and with a property ''fictional equivalent of '' with a class as value, such as <human>, we can infer that it could have a birth date.

I am certainly not advocating to create a separate set of properties for fictional items, I am just saying that if you do not have them, you will need to explicitly filter out fictional items in the query. If I understand correctly, you propose to do it by checking that the item is\"instance of human\". I do not see why we should lump information about information about fictionality and about humanness. As I explained above, that will make claims about fictional items messy, and even for queries about real items, it may make some queries complicated (if the list of Senators can include a horse, you cannot use \"& instance of human\". You would need to have \"& instance of non-fictional thing\", which is not such a straightforward thing to do without a \"is fictional\" property). ---[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 15:16, 9 September 2013 (UTC)\n::: I don't know which one is more straightforward than the other, this still need a manpage ;).

Once we defined Harry Potter as \" fictional character\" we can use the usual properties for real world: we do not need of \"fictional nationality\", or \"fictional date of birth\" because the property P31 makes Harry Potter fictional, not the other properties!  For me is not so strange use the normal \"parent relations\" to make the genealogical tree of Aragorn.\n:::: IMHO, with this kind of classification, we can use more interesting properties: one for the creator(s) of fictional characters, one for the universe where they \"live\", one for the books or films with them... and they may be managed with the usual constraint mechanism. --[[User:Paperoastro|Paperoastro]] ([[User talk:Paperoastro|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 21:27, 9 September 2013 (UTC)\n::::::@Paperoastro: I agree that properties like: \"fictional date of birth\" do not seem necessary; But the concern is: how do we remove fictional things from queries with maximal accuracy, minimal cost and minimal effort. I do not think that \"fictional character\" is the right solution for that. . \n::::::@TomT0m, Creating fictional items would be equivalent to creating fictional properties, but only if it is done for all items, used in all properties of fictional item. The query \"magician born in 1980\" filters out fictional magicians only if we use \"{{P|106}}: fictional magician\". To be consistent, we should also have: \"birth place: fictional Paris\", etc. That seems rather heavy handed. --[[User:Zolo|Zolo]] ([[User talk:Zolo|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 07:39, 10 September 2013 (UTC)\n::::::: I don't think it's heavy handed, creating an item is really easy (and could become even easier with a better interface), much easier than to create a property for example, and the ''fictional equivalent of'' property could make really easy to find if your item already hava fictional(s) equivalent. If it's just a matter of convention, I really see no functional problem with this solution, it separates clearly between fictional or not stuff without losing the real world equivalent, and it's not much a problem for the user as he needs anyway ti learn the conventions. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 10:54, 10 September 2013 (UTC)\n:::::::: I think the solution is heavy-handed, but necessary.  The most important criterion for a solution is that it ensures fictional entities are excluded by default in query results sets -- e.g., that no filtering needs to be done to exclude Harry Potter from the results of the simple query \"persons born in the United Kingdom in 1980\".  The natural {{Q|1}} should be the default [[:en:Domain_of_discourse|domain of discourse]].  If users want to include results from fictional universes, they should need to do something special, like prepend \"fictional\" to the value of the claim they're looking to satisfy in their query.\n:::::::: The solution TomT0m and I support does this.  However, this can only be applied to properties that have an item or string datatype.  We need a solution that will work with non-string-like datatypes -- e.g. date, number.  If a query \"born in 1980\" returns Harry Potter, I think this is still a major problem.

On the other hand,  it could indeed make basic queries simpler, so I am not radically opposed to i.

It would be useful to have a gadget that allow us to show (and check!) the \"tree of items\" made with these two properties. There is the [[Template:Tree]] that shows the main items of the \"sub-item\" with a certain number of iteration, but it would be useful also the inverse: the possibility to show all the the subclass of an item from the \"main item\" to its sub, sub-sub (and so on) items. --[[User:Paperoastro|Paperoastro]] ([[User talk:Paperoastro|talk]]) 15:22, 21 August 2013 (UTC)\n: I created {{tl|Subclasses tree}} based on this template indeed, but it needs to be the other way around :).

If an item has multiple {{P|31}} or {{P|279}} values, then its type hierarchy is a [[:en:Directed acyclic graph|DAG]], not a tree.]]\nPlease note that the hierarchies formed by {{P|31}} and {{P|279}} are [[:en:Directed acyclic graph|directed acyclic graphs]] (DAGs), not necessarily trees.  This is because an item can have multiple {{P|31}} or {{P|279}} values.\n\nFor example, consider {{Q|Q2685}}.  Schwarzenegger is an instance of an actor and an instance of a politician.  Although it's useful to be able to classify Schwarzenegger as having properties of both actors and politicians, a tree cannot capture this sort of relationship. \n\nThe same need arises with classes.  For example, consider how Sequence Ontology (SO), a Semantic Web ontology widely used in biology,  classifies the concept \"[http://sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001872 rearrangement breakpoint]\". (A rearrangement breakpoint is an important idea in evolution, genetic diseases, oncology, etc.; the hierarchy is visualized [http://topaz.genetics.utah.edu/img/dag_gif/current_svn/SO:0001872_sm.png here].)  SO classifies a rearrangement breakpoint as a class of \"biological region\" and \"structural alteration\".  Like Schwarzenegger as an instance of an actor and a politician, rearrangement breakpoint as a class of biological region and structural alteration cannot be represented by a tree.  These classifications require DAGs.  \n\nOf course, implementing a way to depict DAG hierarchies for P31 and P279 is another question!  Beyond simply requiring a way to represent an item having edges to multiple parent classes, we also need to explore how [[:en:Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem|the diamond problem]] entailed by the multiple inheritance could affect our structured data, and how to resolve any problems that emerge there.  I'm not as concerned with solving those issues here -- well-designed languages like Python support multiple inheritance and have solved the diamond problem -- my point is that we should be aware that P31 and P279 can be used in a way that cannot be represented by a tree data structure. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 15:20, 31 August 2013 (UTC)\n: I see no diamond problem at first sight here in OWL for example. A class is essentially a predicate, a subclass just add constraints to the predicates on the properties that an instance already have, and constraints to maybe other properties. Then multiple inheritance just is the conjuction of predicates on all parent classes, no need to ''select'' values differently depending on the father class. For exemple, imagine a ''Young men astronauts'' classes, We could have a ''Man'' class which imply that the sex is ''male'', is a subclass of ''Human being'', a class ''young man'' which add a constraint to the date of birth (first problem here, it's not the current age we want but the age he had when he was an astronaut, may be solved by a qualifier on the class statement on when the predicate was true). The other parent subclass would be ''astronaut'', which has it's own constraints, the instance is a beeing, which is already true by the other parent class, and went is space or as astronaut as an occupation. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]]) 11:27, 1 September 2013 (UTC)\n:: I think that the use of \"instance of\" for describing Arnold Schwarzenegger as actor or politician is wrong because we already have properties to do that job (in that case occupation or office held).

We have to provide another classification scheme either with a new peoperty or with instance of and subclass of system. If we selact the second possibility we have to propose the basis of the classification scheme in order create vertical classification (meaning more than 2 or 3 levels). An horizontal scheme is useless from classification or search point of view because you need to know too many classes.

[[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|talk]]) 18:10, 5 September 2013 (UTC)\n:: I think Snipre's suggestion to start thinking about an [[:en:upper ontology|upper ontology]] is a good idea.  However, constructing our own upper ontology from scratch strikes me as a bad idea.  I think we should be looking more toward adopting or importing an external upper ontology, for example [[:en:Suggested_Upper_Merged_Ontology|SUMO]], [[:en:UMBEL|UMBEL]], [[:en:Basic Formal Ontology|BFO]], etc.  While I think most would agree that the [http://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/gnd GND ontology] is not a good upper ontology for Wikidata, I don't think there's much more we can take for granted than that.  This deserves its own RFC.  Since the classes of GND main type cover a fairly limited domain, I don't think we need to have an upper ontology hammered out before we can migrate away from P107. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 00:51, 5 September 2013 (UTC)\n::: I want to +1 that it would be foolish to attempt to invent, apriori, a new upper ontology.  I would like to see a way for this to evolve from community action - perhaps by using inference behind the scenes to infer the classes of items based on the properties assigned to them as in OWL reasoning, but that seems like a stretch..  Barring that, and if you want to attempt to impose an upper ontology I think you(we?) not only need to decide which one to use (SUMO, UMBEL..), but this needs to be made a consistent part of the technical infrastructure.  By that I mean, when a person goes to create a new item, they should be forced to classify the item somewhere into the upper ontology by the interface.  Further, when new properties are created, they should have to define what of the domain and range of the property is in terms of classes in the upper ontology.  When someone attempts to use that property to describe something, their choices (in a GUI editor for example) should be constrained to be in the appropriate upper class.  (and this would require hierarchical reasoning from the API).  If that kind of tooling does not appear, I worry that the effort expended in picking an upper ontology would be wasted as few people would end up using it appropriately. [[User:Genewiki123|Genewiki123]] ([[User talk:Genewiki123|talk]]) 19:18, 5 September 2013 (UTC) \n:::: Built-in constraints like you describe are very unlikely to be implemented, at least for quite a while.  [[User:Denny|Denny]] makes the case for this in his essay [http://blog.wikimedia.de/2013/02/22/restricting-the-world/ Restricting the World].  I wonder how feasible it would be to support multiple upper ontologies (and type hierarchies as a whole), perhaps by using a qualifier in P31 and P279 to indicate which third-party ontology the P31/P279 classification is based on. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 00:51, 6 September 2013 (UTC)\n::::: OK, no hard constraints..   If you want to support multiple upper ontologies, why not just leave them outside of wikidata on the semantic web and then establish equivalency links between classes in them and the appropriate items in wikidata?  This would be fully unconstrained but of course means that any sort of reasoning or automation would need to be able to import those ontologies.  But.. since we don't have any reasoning happening anyway in wikidata, it seems not to be a big problem.  If you want to drive the community towards more consistent semantics, I think you'd be better off going with an RFC to decide on which upper ontology to prefer, doing some engineeering to bring it in, but then only enforcing its use socially - as an editorial guideline.  If someone decides they want to import another vocabulary for some reason, I don't think they should be stopped, just discouraged if there is a lot of conflict.  [[User:Genewiki123|Genewiki123]] ([[User talk:Genewiki123|talk]]) 17:37, 6 September 2013 (UTC)\n:::::: @[[User:Genewiki123|Genewiki123]] Built-in constraints are not necessary: external bots can do the same job by cross-checking data and then can correct some errors or at least spot problems. I don't really think that building an ontology is a big problem if 1) we try to keep the number of different classes very low (<100), 2) we avoid a to high abstraction. As Izno said just take the present use of subclass/instance of properties and see what is the comon ontology of wikidata contributors: a wikidata ontology aims to create subsets of the DB for faster queries and data analysises. For more sharper classification specific properties are used. Here we can play between the ontology and the properties to keep the system simple. Again we are speaking about an upper ontology.

In addition you can add a qualifier to the P119 which marks the most specific coordinates of the grave. Is there any need to be more specific than that?

September 2013\n|}\n\n\n\n<center>This page is for the proposal</center>\n<br/>\n<center><big><big>For discussion and comments go to the [[Wikidata talk:Requests for comment/Can we reuse anything from DBpedia?|talk page]]</big></big></center>\n\nIt has been suggested that DBpedia has already done a lot of development on converting infoboxes into semantic data and we could profit by studying what they have done and seeing what can be reused.\n \nThe Dbpedia ontology is described in [http://mappings.dbpedia.org/index.php/Main_Page their wiki]. This wiki describes the various entities used on DB pedia. These include:\n\n===Instances===\nDBpedia '''Instances''' correspond to wikidata '''Items'''. DB pedia has [http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Ontology?v=194q over 2,350,000 instances].\n\n===Classes===\nThese are similar to wikidata classes except that they seem to be hard coded into the ontology. They are [http://mappings.dbpedia.org/server/ontology/classes/ listed here]. By my count there are [http://mappings.dbpedia.org/index.php?title=Special:AllPages&namespace=200 578 different classes], nested as shown on that page up to 5 deep. \n\nThe arrangement of classes in practice can be different on the two projects. For instance\n* 'Administrative Region' on DBpedia is a subclass of Region -> Populated Place -> Place -> Thing.\n* 'City' is not a subclass of 'Administrative region'. It is a subclass of Settlement -> Populated Place -> Place -> Thing.\n\nClasses have an important function in defining the constraints on the use of properties.\n\n: {{Comment}} It's like in Mnchester Syntax (see rfc I wrote about class and instances). A class is defined in text, and not in the datas, and it can be defined (among other things) by an expression on the value on certain properties and by subclassing, for example the class ''Woman'' can be define by ''is a subclass of'' <Human beeing> and ''the value of the property <sex> for the instances is <female>''. I think we can do similar things in Wikidata with certain properties applying to classes item that defines the constraints that could be checked by bot, or on contraints on a ''class item'' written on its discussion page, as we have constraints on properties now. [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] ([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]])\n\n===Datatypes===\n[http://mappings.dbpedia.org/index.php/DBpedia_Datatypes Datatypes] are arranged in a \"hierarchy\" by thing being measured (eg Length, Area). By my count there are [http://mappings.dbpedia.org/index.php?title=Special:AllPages&namespace=206 381 datatypes] listed on DBpedia. Most of these are what wikidata considers to be dimensions for the Wikidata 'number with dimension' datatype, including a datatype for each currency and numerous datatypes for measurement units.\n\nDBpedia also uses all XSD types, including the following date/time datatypes:\n* Xsd:date\n* Xsd:dateTime\n* Xsd:gDay\n* Xsd:gMonth\t\n* Xsd:gMonthDay\t\n* Xsd:gYear\n* Xsd:gYearMonth\n* Xsd:time\nNote that where DBpedia reuses a dataype or property from another ontology it adds a prefix to identify where it has come from.\n\nDBpedia datatypes seem to work very differently from those on Wikidata. I doubt it is practical to reuse any of their work here on Wikidata.\n\n===Properties=== \n\nBy my count DBpedia [http://mappings.dbpedia.org/index.php?title=Special:AllPages&namespace=202 has 2547 properties].\n\nFor each property is defined the following:\n* rdfs:label@en - the label of the property in English (some properties have labels in other languages as well)\n* rdfs:comment@en - a description of the property in English.\n* rdfs:domain - the class of objects (= wikidata items) that can have this property\n* rdfs:range - The class of objects (=wikidata items) or the datatype that this property can link to\n* rdf:type\t- Not sure. Doesn't seem to be used much.\n* rdfs:subPropertyOf - Not sure. Doesn't seem to be used much.\t\n* owl:equivalentProperty - Not sure. Doesn't seem to be used much.\n* owl:propertyDisjointWith - Not sure. Doesn't seem to be used much.\n\nAs far as I can see these are largely modelled around the Wikimedia infoboxes. As the infoboxes are oriented towards presentation rather than data representation this leads to some oddities such as about a hundred properties named 'numberoffoo' rather than counting the actual number of foos - as wikidata seems to prefer to do.\n\nNote that DBpedia does not seem to have qualifiers which presumably means it needs more properties.\n\n===Mappings===\nA '''mapping''' is a link from a 'template property' in a wikipedia template (mostly infoboxes but some other templates too) to the corresponding DBpedia property.\nBy my count DBpedia are working on [http://mappings.dbpedia.org/index.php/Mapping_en 440 Templates] from the English wikipedia plus many more on other language wikipedias.\n\n== Comments ==\n\nI am sure that DBPedia has many properties that will also be relevant to Wikidata. On the other hand, since DBPedia has a different goal (extraction from existing templates) and a different datamodel (no references, no qualifiers, different data types), it is also clear that many properties would rather be done differently in Wikidata. So in the end one always needs to look at every single property to decide if and how this would fit into Wikidata. I think one just cannot make such a decision in general for some 2500 properties across all domains without consulting with the experts in each domain individually. (I still think it is important to record this discussion somewhere on this wiki, so thanks for launching this RfC) --[[User:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch]] ([[User talk:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 17:39, 20 September 2013 (UTC)\n\n{{dbot}}"

The supporting resp. opposing arguments should come from the commenting community members in the respective sections and I hope you understand that.<br />The reasons for proposing this seemed quite obvious to me. Firstly, we would reduce the admin's workload by 1 rather needless task. Secondly, autopromotion is a very effective way to prevent any kind of hat collecting as wikis like the German language Wikipedia or the English language Wikibooks who already assign their minor flags via autopromotion already have shown. For example, drama-causing situations like the WorldTraveller101 case would be very unlikely to happen again. I consider these tiny advantages to be stronger than any risk which would be caused by the rather unlikely case that autoconfirmed is \"gamed\" by vandals.

It's not like administrators have excessively ''difficult'' work on a timeline, like closing AfDs on en.wp.

Which, by the way, hat-collecting to me is getting a right and then not using it, for which we a) already have protections; and b) doesn't do any harm to the wiki any way for those which don't have protections. ''If'' hat-collecting to you means \"getting a right and then ''abusing'' it\", then see case (a) of the previous statement. Most rights are trivially removed, which is a ''positive'' reason I would rather have finely-grained rights than have the kinds of monolithic rights that would make up autoconfirmed in your world or which make up sysop in both of our worlds.\n#:::; drama-causing situations like the WorldTraveller101 case would be very unlikely to happen again\n#:::: I would rather have drama-causing situations for every single questionable case. Every single one. Because it leaves the power with the wiki-users who are already trusted and established, rather than those who, in exactly such a case, are questionable.

The often quoted concerns that it isn't possible to provide edit summaries with rollback or that it is too easy to hit can easily be fixed with 1 line of JS in either the wiki's common.js or in the user's personal one.

For example, a photograph on the Commons may depict one or more feature recorded in the OSM Planet. These features can be referenced from the Commons item page, and automatically link to the OSM feature. If the cross-reference contains machine-readable information, services may be built on top of the linked open data.\n\nWikidata seems like the 'correct' place to store these references. The reference statement may take the form:\n  '''Commons Item''' depicts '''OSM Feature''' as of '''Date'''\n\n=Concerns=\n* OSM features may be deleted, or hidden.\n* OSM features may be edited.\n* OSM features are classified in three distinct types: Nodes, Ways, and Relations\n* Cross-referencing may be difficult or add several steps to the contributor workflow\n\n=Data Model=\nThe Wikidata Data Model may already be sufficient to allow for OSM references. Wikidata has one property related to OpenStreetMap:\n* [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P402 OpenStreetMap Relation ID]\n\nCommons media can be referenced to OSM entities through text properties containing\n* '''OSM Entity ID'''\n* '''OSM Feature Type''' \n\nBoth properties are necessary as OSM may have duplicate ID numbers between feature types.\n\nWikidata Items may also use the URL data type to link directly to the OSM feature. The URL can also be used to fulfill the '''source''' reference.\n\n=Additional Discussion=\nThis idea has been submitted for discussion on the [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump#OpenStreetMap_features_template Wikimedia Commons: Village Pump]\n\nThere is also a [http://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?pid=371372 thread on the OSM forum] related to this RFC.\n{{dbot}}"

It will draw upon [[w:GNU Units]] (see [http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/units/units.dat conversion table here]) for reference.\n* Most probably dimensions (length, speed, etc) will be associated with properties on creation with a configurable default unit (meter, km/h, etc). When setting a value, another unit of the same dimension can be selected.\n* On the client wikis, it will (eventually) be possible to specify a unit for display, with the software taking care of the appropriate conversion. \n* Feedback is appreciated on which dimensions and units should be implemented first, and also to detect special cases/needs..\n\nBelow there are the dimensions mentioned on \"[[w:Conversion_of_units#Tables_of_conversion_factors|Conversion of units]]\".

The effect of receiving a certain dose of radiation (given as Gy) is variable and depends on many factors, thus a new unit was needed to denote the biological effectiveness of that dose on the body; this is known as the equivalent dose and is shown in Sv. The general relationship between absorbed dose and equivalent dose can be represented as\n:''H = Q \u00b7 D''\nwhere ''H'' is the equivalent dose, ''D'' is the absorbed dose, and ''Q'' is a dimensionless quality factor. Thus, for any quantity of ''D'' measured in Gy, the numerical value for ''H'' measured in Sv may be different.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CIPM/db/2002/2/ | title=Comit\u00e9 international des poids et mesures, 2002, Recommendation 2 | accessdate=August 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Concentration and chemical composition ===\n{{Q|Q8919525}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ {{Q|3686031}} and {{Q|1263816}}\n!Name of unit\n!Symbol\n!Definition\n!Relation to SI units\n|-style=\"background:#dfd;\"\n| {{Q|672821}} (SI-standard) || mol/m\u00b3\n| 1 mol of a substance in one m\u00b3\n|\n|- \n| {{Q|11229}}   ||  %\n| percentage\n|- \n| {{Q|672821}}  (in liters) || mol/l<br>mol/dm\u00b3\n| 1 mol of a substance in one l or dm\u00b3\n| \u2261 1000 mol/m\u00b3\n|-style=\"background:#dfd;\"\n| {{Q|589446}} (SI-standard) || kg/m\u00b3\n| 1 kg of a substance in one m\u00b3\n| \n|-\n| {{Q|589446}} (Commonly used in biology) || g/100 ml\n| 1 g of a substance in 100 ml\n|\n|-\n| {{Q|899138}}<br>{{Q|Q1563068}} || kg/kg\n| How many kg of a substance in 1 kg of a mixture/compound/solution/alloy.

They were created as a way to explore the implications of classifying all subjects like {{Q|45661}} as [[Q14870023|human person]].  That discussion was interesting and you should [[Wikidata:Requests_for_comment/Migrating_away_from_GND_main_type#P31_value_for_things_like_Coco_Chanel|check it out]], but I want to emphasize that '''this RFC should not be about whether we should classify things as human nonperson or nonhuman person'''.  (FWIW, we should not do that, it's a horrible idea; these items should be deleted; but first see below.)\n: '''This RFC should be about a procedural matter for concluded RFCs''', and perhaps more generally about how we improve labels for deleted items and properties so that archived discussions can be feasibly understood.  For example, let's say we delete the three items that triggered this RFC -- {{Q|14870023}}, {{Q|14914342}} and {{Q|14896454}}.  If we delete those items without changing their usages in the [[Wikidata:Requests_for_comment/Migrating_away_from_GND_main_type|archived RFC in question]] from using [[Template:Q]], then instead of seeing intelligible labels for those items we would see red '(no label)' links, like {{Q|14897290}}.  It would make that conversation very difficult to comprehend.\n: The solution to this problem is simple.  Let's get consensus that changing links to deleted items in archived discussions, including concluded RFCs, is OK.  In other words, let's establish that it's not a problem to edit archived discussions like [[Wikidata:Requests_for_comment/Migrating_away_from_GND_main_type]] (even though it says in bold red \"Please do not modify it\") and change links to soon-to-be-deleted items like {{Q|14896454}} to [[Q14896454|human nonperson]].  This way we can make sense of past conversations.

This is needed so item Qreferences are stable and persistent and don't disappear. This will be important when external websites start to use data from Wikidata. When redirects happen we need to develop a template to link to redirected Qitems. <br>\n'human person' should redirect to 'human'; 'non-human person' should redirect to 'person' or 'legal personality'; I have no idea what a 'human non-person' is or what it should redirect to - if we had redirects.

One of the two he mentioned was fairly active (but not active all the time) and he was warned that in 24 hours he was going to be desysopped and he was 1 action short. Luckily they came back and made a few. 24 hours is not enough, however, and if someone gets caught up doing something offline and they are a couple actions short, it's not particularly fair if they just can't make it to a computer within 24 hours. And with no way to regain adminship other than RFA again, it makes it all the worse. We just need to extend good faith to our less than active administrators that they come back and do something with an earlier warning. The point of inactivity policies is to desysop administrators who are no longer here, not to get rid of administrators who are here but fall short of our standards by pushing them out the door forcibly.

I would like to propose that ''both'' be implemented.  I agree that \"statements on property pages\" are crucial, for hinting, affordances, and validation can be automated, but I think it's also really important that it be possible to include human-readable documentation on properties.  Especially for newbies, lists of statements are very intimidating, and just do not serve as \"documentation\".  Also, there's lots of information that can't be included in a statement; for example, step-by-step instructions on how to determine an GeneReviews identifier from the name of a disease.\nI'd like to propose that the template/doc automatic transclusion mechanism be implemented as soon as possible for property pages.

There is nothing new here -- I just want to make sure that what I am suggesting is very clear.\n\nI propose that there be an automatic transclusion mechanism for property documentation, which works the same way that template documentation does.  That is, ''if there exists'' a page such as, for example, [[Doc:P1055]], that it be automatically transcluded into the main property page, [[Property:P1055]].  I think this could be done in an unobtrusive way, perhaps in an expand/collapse block immediately under the title, which is collapsed by default.\n\nThis would be analogous to the way that, for example [[w:Template:Infobox_disease/doc]] is transcluded into [[w:Template:Infobox_disease]].\n\n'''Rationale:'''\n\nThis would allow human-written, and human-readable prose documentation, which I think is very important.  I am pretty new here, but have been participating in a lot of discussions about properties, and what is immediately clear is that there is a lot of confusion about how these should be used, and no adequate mechanism for communicating decisions to later users/editors, once consensus has been reached.\n\nIn the [[Wikidata:Requests_for_comment/Place_of_the_property_documentation|earlier RfC]], that this one stems from, it was decided to \"Include property documentation by 'statements on property page'\" (see also [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49554 this enhancement task]).  While I fully support this, and definitely see the usefulness of machine-readable constraints, I see it as an orthogonal issue.\n\nSometimes there is no substitute for prose documentation.  Having a separate wiki page where it could be written, and which would be unconstrained in length, and allow multiple sections, would be very valuable.  For example, one could give details about use cases, with examples, and links to other sources of information.  Just look at (any of the subsections) of the Infobox_disease documentation for examples of what I mean.\n\nI proposed the namespace \"Doc\" above, because having the page at 'Property:P1055/doc' (mirroring the way it's done with templates) would not work, since that would be interpreted as an item page.  'Property_doc:' might be a better choice, I'm not sure.\n\nI have to say I'm a little vexed by the comments above that this is inappropriate, or that I'm wasting people's time, without any justification.

I think it is better to investigate its planes before creating some new documentation mechanism. This can save us from double work. \u2014 [[User:Ivan A. Krestinin|Ivan A. Krestinin]] ([[User talk:Ivan A. Krestinin|talk]]) 19:42, 11 January 2014 (UTC)\n::That's basically what John F. Lewis said above, and I asked on the email list, and got a pointer to [[Wikidata:Project_chat/Archive/2013/10#Property_Metadata|this discussion on Property Metadata]], which seems to have resulted in (or, at least, be related to) [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49554 this enhancement task].  Sorry, I should have mentioned that above.  So, basically, the way I read those is that they are about supporting statements on properties, not about human-readable documentation.

But that's not the main issue.  As I attempted to describe, statements are not a substitute for some kinds of human-readable documentation. [[User:Klortho|Klortho]] ([[User talk:Klortho|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 20:22, 11 January 2014 (UTC)\n\n: {{Comment}}: [[User:Klortho|Klortho]], see [[Property:P492]] and [[Property_talk:P492/footer]].  It should be possible to use transcluded 'footer' pages as a mechanism for what you're trying to achieve.  (Kudos go to [[User:Multichill|Multichill]] for developing support for 'footer' transclusion.)  We could include both prose and [[Template_talk:Property_documentation#Parameter_enhancements|enhanced property parameters]] on that page via the [[Template:Statement|Statement]] template.  (Of course, statements about properties wouldn't be tied into Wikibase, but it would be a good [[:en:Desire_path|desire path]] to hint to developers that we want them.) [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 19:58, 11 January 2014 (UTC)\n:: Yes, that seems very close.  Does that mean you support this idea?  Where was this discussed?  Is this just a proof-of-concept, or is it something official? I am not crazy about \"footer\" for the name, because it conflates a presentation concept with its intended purpose. [[User:Klortho|Klortho]] ([[User talk:Klortho|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 20:31, 11 January 2014 (UTC)\n::: [[User:Klortho|Klortho]], I'm inclined to use 'footer' in a manner closer to http://dbpedia.org/ontology/capital than [[:en:Template:Infobox_disease/doc]].  In other words, I think the 'Property' namespace and its pages should prioritize statements about a property -- like the Q namespace does for items.  This would indicate that we desire to treat properties like they are in OWL, defining properties for properties like [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain rdfs:domain], etc.  It would entail creating new properties 'domain', 'range', 'one of', etc. and applying them only to resources in the Property namespace via soemthing like the [[Template:Statement|Statement]] template and not applying those properties in the Q namespace.  \n::: The extended prose documentation you cite as being needed for P21 has traditionally been handled at the top of the property's talk page.  I agree that this documentation needs to be prominent, but I lean toward not putting it on the property page itself.  I think the very top of the property talk page might be more appropriate.  Make it the first thing the user sees upon going to the property talk page.  Move the 'one of', 'single value' etc. completely off the talk page and to the property page -- since those templates are really making direct, semantic statements about the property.

Look at [[Property_talk:P21#Transgender_.2F_Cisgender_changes|this lengthy discussion]] on the naming and usage of {{P|21}}.  It's very controversial, and, since it's an extremely common property, important.  Participants expended (a combined) tens, if not hundreds, of hours on the discussion, and the results (which are still a bit up in the air, I think) are non-intuitive.  So, as I suggested [[Property_talk:P21#Still_to_do|here]], it would be really nice to document the outcomes as a set of examples with best practices recommendations.  There are lots of complexities and nuances, that, in my opinion, would be impossible to capture in anything but prose.\n::* For authority properties, it would be nice to provide descriptions of the identifiers, and/or instructions for how an identifier could be found on the external site.

Let me try to give you an example: have a look at {{Q|Q5377577}} which is a series of books, then click on WhatLinksHere and you will discover the books in this series. Moreover, the second book [http://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q5451294&oldid=97792158 Fire] has not yet a link to the first book. And again WhatLinksHere helps you to find the first book. But there should be easier ways to see the relevant information. As you wrote, we want all information on one page (if it is reasonable for loading times and still humanly parsable). Until now, we only see \"forward information\" on pages, e.g. on the page {{Q|5451294}} you will see that {{Q|5451294}} -> {{P|361}} -> {{Q|Q5377577}}. But we should also see (some) \"backwards information\" about the items, e.g. {{Q|7723069}} <- {{P|156}} <- {{Q|5451294}} on the page of {{Q|5451294}}, which would just be one statement stored in the page {{Q|7723069}}. This way, we only have one statement which is shown on two different pages! If we change the one statement, then clearly both appearance will be changed.\n::Actually, I think it is quite common with Linked Data to see also (some) backward information, e.g. \"is <nowiki>{Property-Name}</nowiki> of\" in [http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Imprint dbpedia] or the software package [http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/#dump Graphite] which uses the forward and backward arrows, or publication about a topic (\"Thema in\") in the GND, e.g. [http://d-nb.info/gnd/7863462-3%20 http://d-nb.info/gnd/7863462-3 ], where clearly the information is stored in the bibliographic items for the individual books. --[[User:Zuphilip|Zuphilip]] ([[User talk:Zuphilip|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 19:04, 12 January 2014 (UTC)\n\n===Generalising to Constraints===\n\n[[User:Zuphilip|Zuphilip]] has suggested to extend this feature, I agree with him.\n\nTake {{Q|142}}, which is instance of {{Q|185441}}, and has as {{P|463}} property the value {{Q|458}}.

What about automatically linking both information together? {{P|6}} could have some kind of determined by some qualifier set to {{Q|1587677}} by editors of the france item, so that {{P|6}} contains a list of all people who have the position held property as {{Q|1587677}}, including sources, start and end dates.\n\nSecond can be modelled with the constraint mechanism, first can't currently be modelled with it.

One frequent topic was how DBpedia and Wikidata could cooperate / coexist and how DBpedia can use its processes of its own update for Wikidata as well. What we came up with is more or less along these lines:\n* The first step is data collection\n* The second step is match the results to Wikidata and DBpedia.\n** produce a lists with differences where Wikidata and the new data differ.\n** update the new information to Wikidata / DBpedia simultaneously\n* Ask the communities to reconcile the differences between the source Wikipedia and Wikidata\n\nThe other thing that is really relevant is that many people at the conferences represented GLAM partners of our movement. There were people from Europeana, the Dutch National Library among others. They are quite interested to run pilot projects on subjects like \"Dutch authors\" and \"Dutch monuments\". These would then be run along the lines as described above. \n\nIn one meeting I mentioned the Commons/Wikidata integration. I explained why the use of the \"Creator\" and \"Institution\" templates are a good step in preparation of this integration. I urged them to keep as much meta data as possible after an initial import so that we may make use of it when the Commons/Wikidata integration is a reality.\n\nFor DBpedia the way we have our \"model\" is/will be very much a challenge on so many levels. They have a big challenge to continuously keep a mapping to what our model happens to be. We do have qualifiers and processes to add but particularly remove properties. They already have a [http://mappings.dbpedia.org/ Wikidata project] for Wikidata so they are aware of many of the issues.\n\nThanks, [[User:GerardM|GerardM]] ([[User talk:GerardM|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 14:12, 5 February 2014 (UTC)\n\n:I did an analysis of the DBpedia ontology and posted it at [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/Can we reuse anything from DBpedia?]]. Their ontology is very different from that of Wikidata and I didn't see any easy way to import from there. No one posted any response to my comment however. Maybe you will get more response. [[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 21:56, 7 February 2014 (UTC)\n\n::The point is not that there are issues using their data, it is that they are going to have a process whereby they update our data using out a mapping that fits us from the data they harvested using their processes.

[[User:GerardM|GerardM]] ([[User talk:GerardM|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 12:20, 10 February 2014 (UTC)\n:\n:: {{U'|Filceolaire}} Gerard is right, the import process is just a question of mapping, nothing not doable with a little code. The mapping is challenging for the Dbpedia guys because the Wikidata ontology is more a matter of nonformal rules and convention than something that has clear formalized patterns, which means the automation of that process is not that easy.

Problems that IMHO Wikidata may finally solve, but that at the same moment cannot be solved, again IMHO, without a common discussion.\n\nFor example, {{Q|389}} links [[:it:Andrea]] to [[:en:Antero]], instead of [[:en:Andrew]] or even [[:en:Andrea]]. Now, \"Antero\" is the Finnish version of \"Andrea\"/\"Andrew\", but then on en.wp (and possibly on other wikis) we have an \"Antero\" article. This replicates with quite every other name (or even surname) we have: Washington is both a name and a surname; Andrea is a feminine name in German, but it's masculine in Italian; Luis, Alois, Luigi are quite the same name, but expressed in different languages; and so on.\n\nThe aim of this RFC is to discuss and lay down some general rules, given also that now we have four properties ({{P|735}}, {{P|734}}, {{P|513}}, {{P|742}}) related to names and surnames. I have an idea about it, which is fairly simple: we use a single item for every kind of name we have, and then we link the similar names with a \"same as\" or \"related to\" property, i.e. Andrea, Antero, Andrew, Andy, Ondrej, Andrei, Andrzej, Andreas, Andr\u00e9s... are each represented by an item, but are all linked with each other through a property.\n\nI want to stress that it's just ''a'' proposal, and not the ''final'' proposal.

Multilingual datatype will be more interesting for some cases like names written in non-latin fonts but even in that case there are 2-5 different ways to write the names. For example Novak Djokovic is the same in French or in English, the difference is only function of the alphabet used to write the name, not of the language.

Where there are separate items in one language for various variants of the name then these should link to a more general item covering all the variants for that name. {{P|734}} and {{P|735}} link to items which are not necessarily spelled exactly the same as the spelling used by the subject.\n::::Where a person has a 'birth name' and a 'pseudonym' and an 'official name' then {{P|734}} and {{P|735}} can be used as a qualifier to those names.

To resolve the item and interwiki conflicts is a good plan, but won't settle the problem, that some persons' names are being translated when used in other language while other persons' names are used in the original. At least, the statements should have a qualifier specifying language(s) of its validity (maybe {{P|407}}, since it has been used as a qualifier for {{P|138}} already...), but it will still be a time-bomb, because if anybody changes the label for one language (e.g. the English label for [[Q1669722|Milosz]] to Mi\u0142osz, Milos or Milo\u0161), hundred's of statements have to be checked and corrected.

This requires both good data on boundaries and names of places. This is an extremely hard problem and the open data for this is highly fragmented across many datasets that add to the problem with problematic categorizations, a bias towards formal administrative names rather than the informal names that people actually use in real life, a lack of good data on boundaries, completeness and correctness of the data, and data licensing. E.g. open street maps is surprisingly useless for this problem since it only includes a few tens of thousands of boundaries for administrative hierarchies world wide. Foursquare made a rather heroic effort to unite several datasets worldwide including geonames, geoplanet and countless open datasets for specific regions. The result is published at quatroshapes.org.  I believe wiki data can contribute in several ways. 1) where possible link to other datasets. A good start would be importing geoplanet woeids and geoname ids on dataitems where possible. I estimate that approximately 500000 wikipedia articles are linked directly from the geonames dataset already and there exist mappings to geoplanet as well. 2) adopt a categorization similar to geoplanet to distinguish e.g. places that have historical meaning (e.g. weimar republic) from formal names such as Bezirk Pankow, which contains several areas with less formal names. Geoplanet data has been archived at the internet archive and is available under cc 3.0 with attribution, if I remember correctly. 3) consider supporting geojson for describing boundaries and other geographic features. Coordinates only have limited use (positioning a map) and good polygon data would be very valuable. 4) identify problems in the data and seek community support for filling the gaps. For example good open neighborhood data is available for large parts of northern America but very hard to come by for e.g. Germany. There are currently no good datasets with global coverage.

For instance, in Spain we have got municipalities with three inhabitants without any problem ({{Q|1381577}}), but in Denmark municipalities must have got a minimum population of 5,000 inhabitants (except for islands). We should use the same common sense which is being used in Wikipedia for municipalities of different countries.[[Special:Contributions/88.14.100.137|88.14.100.137]] 16:21, 6 February 2015 (UTC)\n{{dbot}}"

This set of instances may correspond to a query, like a list or a category usually do. Then we should link the categories or lists items to the class with the query. As we often have both a list or a category which should have the same set of instances, it seems a better solution to put just the query. Plus the subclass relationship looks a lot like the subcategory. Of course categories are less well defined and they sometime looks more like the informations about close items reasonator sometime shows.

In Wikidata, we can do better, and it's a feature we can define a class wrt. its properties imho. We can technically handle this and this allows to use this powerfulness to model things, and not to make a war of intersection categorist versus non intersection categorists. We can also see this as a way to tag queries with a name and use this query as class. Then if we have a property which as a specific domain, for example the swedish professors, we don't have to catch a headeach to know how we define the range or domain. ''Oh, the range is <person> as its a leaf of the class tree, but we will only accept a subset of this class for this property !! how will we solve this ?''. We don't, we have a solution, we have a class, we have the corresponding query. Of course we do not have  to make an item if we use some kind of class expression as in OWL, but I really don't think it's a good thing to make a rule of ''never create a class item when we can substitute it with a class expression''. It's bad for reuse for example. To sort classes we have class classification, and I think it's a good practice to think in term of class classification to make things flexible and allow people to use the model they want to use and not use what they do not want to.

There is plenty of cases where the distinction between a class and a query is quite blurry and a tough decision to make. A standard modeling language like OWL allows to define classes not only through the subclass of relation but also by a query on these properties. It is useful also for defining the domain and ranges of properties : the range ''human'' is quite unprecise for example if we want to model that only a french citizen can be a candidate of french presidential elections. I'm quite dubious that saying ''there is classes and there is queries, the two do not mixes this would be silly'' will help on any way.

Unfortunately some articles about the class are judged list article or even worse disambig articles in other cases, which makes a big mess to clean up. Formally a list article lists a subset of the instances of a class, but sometimes there is text annotations to the items ad an introduction, and this makes a bit fuzzy the limit, especially when there is no corresponding article about the class. Conversely a typical class article may include a sample list of instances. To restore the interwikis when there is two item how about a template generating a link to reasonator using ''is a list of'' to find the relevant items, insested into the articles who have a lit  <-> associated class ? Reasonator can handle this (that and generate a list of instances). I guess the difference beetween a list of instances class/named query and a list articles is that the items shown in the list article can be chosen, ordered and commented.

Classes will have the 'subclass of' property and may have the 'instance of' property (for special types of class Ford Mondeo:Subclass of:car; Instance of:car model). These can have links to appropriate WP pages which describe the Class. Some of these may list every instance of the class. Some of the WP pages may be called 'List of...'. That doesn't change the fact that the wikidata item is for a class and it should never have the property instance of:Wikimedia list. \n\nIn a few cases the WP page will get a long discussion of the class and they will decide to break out the List of page as a separate WP page. This can lead to there being 2 wikidata Qitems, one of which has properties which describe the Class and one of which has properties which describe the list, including instance of:Wikimedia list. Down the road a bit it would be a nice feature if 'List' items include a link to a query which would create a  list based on Wikidata items that should be on that list.\n\nOK?[[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 13:01, 25 February 2014 (UTC)\n:Hmm Collapse top/Collapse bottom didn't work the way I thought.

If we can associate a query to a list item, and that list item is linked to a class item, then the query defines the instances of the class. So it is the definition of the class itself or a part of it, hence it should be linked directly to the class. Apart from that question I think there is no real problem to solve at that point into this RfC as long as the Wikibase query are not implemented, to agree with {{U'|Izno}}. That's all.

What you (and others) are failing to distinguish is that a class has a certain set of properties which may be shared by its instances, while a list enumerates the members of that class (or multiple classes).\n:I would have no objection to distinguishing between a plural/list page being used as the list page, while a singular page-name is used to represent the \"unlinked\" but more proper subclass claim.\n:Example: \"king of Sweden\" gets no wikilinks but does carry the subclass of \"king\" claim.

If we're classifying lists (which is what they really are!!!) as the subclasses, then we are implicitly doing so...<p>But that aside, the reason we should not is because \"monarchs of Sweden\" is not the head of Sweden. \"monarch of Sweden\" is. Once you change it from the plural to the singular, no longer are you referring to the list or plurality of monarchs, you are referring to a single one, or the class of those persons. External users will ''not'' expect the related content to be about all of the monarchs in an item titled \"monarch of Sweden\".<p>That aside, there is also the \"list of\" claim combined with P31 \"list\". You have not shown that it is ''helpful'', and I would certain treat it as harmful, to use such claim on an item in the subclass tree. That is ''another'' thing that external users will not expect. Fundamentally, it comes down to how we classify our items, and we should do so in an easily-expected fashion. There should be a list item and a class item. I don't really care where the links get held (if they get held in the list item, fine by me!), but given that some topics have both a list and a class item and some topics only have the class item, this is the most deterministic option available to us.

I believe there are cases where a Disambiguation page can be a class.\n\nMost disambiguation (DB) pages list items with the same or similar names which are otherwise unrelated but some list items which have the same name because they are related. Typical cases (numbered for your commenting convenience):\n# 'Battle of Bar' disambiguation linking to 'First battle of Bar' and 'Second battle of Bar'. Often you find other WPs have one page discussing both battles rather than two separate pages and a DB.\n# Surname pages. Some DB pages have a list entirely composed of people with the same surname (maybe with a couple of places named after people with this surname) but there is no separate page discussing the origin/popularity of that surname nor ever will there ever be because the obvious place for this info is as a lead paragraph on the DB page. Why can't the {{P|734}} property point to these pages? Once I labelled these as instances of {{Q|11651459}} but the deletionists have got rid of that. Oh well. \n[[User:Filceolaire|Filceolaire]] ([[User talk:Filceolaire|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 09:07, 25 February 2014 (UTC)\n\n:As far as I am concerned, it is irrelevant what Wikipedia says. There are lists that are unstructured, there are categories that are unstructured and why not disambiguation pages as well. The point is that when there is structure it is explicit. When an item is defined as \"is a list of\" it is a list of something definable. This is how it is made explicit.\n\n:When something is made explicit as a list or a subclass, it has implications for the labels used. What is linked to an item is a secondary discussion.

If the only WP pages related to that class have a one line intro and a list of the class members then '''can we include a sitelink to that WP page on the class Qitem?''' If the answer is yes then most lists disappear from wikidata because they won't have a Qitem separate from the class Qitem.

Funny to see it's appening exactly when this discussion is occuring, but it seems that one of the page was a list of episodes. It seems that things have their own life independantly from decision making in Wikidata :). Don't really know what to do with this fact alone though <small>&nbsp;&ndash; {{Autotranslate|base=Unsigned/text|1=TomT0m|2=}}</small><!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned-->\n\n== Lists and categories as queries ==\nFor me there is no much difference between categories, lists and queries, but of course some differences can be agreed on to know the scope of each concept. IMHO:\n* Lists are pre-defined queries, the results don't need to be the same as manual Wikipedia lists\n* Categories are \"zoomable\" queries, where you have hints in which direction to \"zoom in\" (sub-categories) and therefore need some sort of hinted structure\n* Some lists have an equivalent category, maybe it makes sense to link them with a \"same as\"\nSo in general I find the proposed method appropriate, and I would even go further to extend it to categories. It is going to be hard to reproduce a categorization tree structure in Wikidata because category trees are very flexible, language dependent, and change over time, however the software could pool the sub-categories proposed by each Wikipedia and suggest some where there is some sort of agreement. And if you want to be really brave, what do you think about renaming the property \"is a list of\" to \"is a query of\"? (Maybe after consulting the WD development team, they might have other ideas for queries).\n\nIf {{ping|Magnus Manske}} has time, I would like to suggest a further development to the WDQ tool, that could work as follows:\n# Once the list has been generated, the user can enter a category of a language wikipedia.\n# Both lists are compared, and only the differences shown\n# The user can click a button add to Wikidata items the missing statements that would make the item appear on the list\nThat way we could keep track easily of missing items and add add the needed properties to all of them.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 13:07, 3 March 2014 (UTC)\n\n:Actually I'm seeing that the [http://tools.wmflabs.org/render/stools/alg Article List Generator] is able to generate article lists from categories, but there is no way of knowing which one of those articles are missing certain wikidata properties.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 19:32, 4 March 2014 (UTC)\n\n== Update: one year on ==\n\nOne year on, and the issue of whether or not to use {{P|360}} to describe categories is again under discussion, this time at [[Property_talk:P360#P360_and_categories]], following on from discussion at [[Wikidata:Project_chat#.22is_a_list_of.22_on_categories]].\n\nSince 2014, [[User:GerardM]] has added inclusion criterion descriptions using {{P|360}} to the items for about 2000 categories, which play well with Reasonator, as predicted. (For example the [https://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?q=Q6473572&lang=en Reasonator entry] for {{Q|6473572}}.\n\nHowever there has been some challenge, since the label for P360 still reads \"is a ''list'' of\", and the property constraints still include \"not to be used on categories\".  One question raised is that what has or has not been put in a particular category might be quite complex, so a first stab (or even a second stab) at a P360 may be introducing a statement onto Wikidata that is not in fact completely true.    One point of view holds that even if not perfect, such statements can give a good and useful enough rationale to describe why most of the contents may have been placed in the category; that an automatically generating exceptions list can be automatically generated, which by highlighting the edge cases may provide exactly what is needed to allow the P360 to be refined; or to exclude the exception list from any data processing based on the category, which an editor may consider good enough; or alternaively to use to identify items that maybe should have missing statements added.  On the other hand, an alternative point of view holds that statements anything less than strictly true risks misleading and dangerous consequences, and so should have no place on Wikidata.\n\nOf the other approaches considered above, the idea of associating each category with a class item, so the members of the category would just be instances of that class, has not been persued.  Although it would lead to a particular straightforward corresponding query, it is weighed against by at least two fundamental considerations.  Firstly the multiplication of items that would be required, to associate with all the myriad entries in the (often ridiculed) multitude of intersection categories that exist. And secondly because of a strong site ethic ''away'' from adding a separate {{P|31}} for each class an item is a member of, but rather in general to instead try to have only a single {{P|31]}, expressing the item's most fundamental nature, with additional aspects specified in properties.  In such a system the items related to a particular class can no longer be found just by looking for {{P|31}} $1, but instead need a query of the for P31 -> A with Pxxx-> $1 , with some overarching class for A (such as {{Q|5}}), plus some particular specific property Pxxx.  Which is in fact just what is coded on the category item by P360.

Taxonomy would probably be the way to go. In fact, some kind of very basic taxonomy is already being put together when [[Wikidata:List_of_properties|categorizing properties]]). However, applying taxonomy classes to items should not be strict retaining the option to add statements to items regardless of the taxonomy classes applied to them. Applying taxonomy would not result in \"x has y\" relations but rather \"x may have y\". Basically, this soft taxonomy would allow grouping/organizing statements on item level and one major benefit of having taxonomy is to be able to order the properties per taxonomy class.<br />That would allow applying similar structure to similar items without sacrificing flexibility.

What are your preferences?\n===Comments about sitelinks===\n*Well, I have already seen items deleted only because they have no notable sitelink to Wikipedia, (but had such to Wikisource), so removing any sitelink in the UI which the ''UI'' does not think is notable to the user, that sounds really risky. I would prefer to have one matrix for all projects, that such mistakes shouldn't happen again. -- [[User:Lavallen|Lavallen]] ([[User talk:Lavallen|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 13:11, 13 March 2014 (UTC)\n* I propose to collapse the sitelinks part by default because after a period of correction, the number of modifications will become very small. But no change to the current display. [[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 17:48, 13 March 2014 (UTC)\n* +1 to having a total number of sitelinks written on top of the sitelink section, and +1 to collapse sitelink lists if the list is >5 links, at least for the languages the user doesn't speak.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 20:34, 13 March 2014 (UTC)\n* +1 for the collapsed list of sitelinks, apart for the relevant languages chosen by users.

Collapsable sitelinks are good but maybe that gadget could keep your set language visible. Collapsing the sitelinks would help the situation Lavallen talked about since it would mean the wikisource sitelinks would be more visible - if the WP links are collapsed then the WS links wouldn't scroll off the page.

While there was much discussion, there was no specific proposal on which there was any consensus, and there has been little activity for almost two years (and none for over 6 months).

Also a large number of examples have been provided on {{P|1001}} that clarify its purpose; it is also used in constraints on other properties and elsewhere so changing its meaning at this point would be disruptive.

In fact, looking at [[Wikidata:Property_proposal/Archive/15#P1001|its original creation discussion]], I cannot quite figure what it's supposed to represent! The potential multiple conflicting meanings of \"jusrisdiction\" are certainly not helping!\n\nMost likely, the constraints defined for it are a major source of problems in defining it, but looking at the [[Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/P1001|constraint violation report]], a few issues really need to be sorted out.\n*Is the property appropriate for distinguishing federal and provincial/state \"jurisdiction\" over nonterritorial organizations like {{Q|214700}}?\n**Me I say such cases should probably be handled by {{P|361}} (to agencies and ultimate to the federal government).\n*Is the property appropriate for administrative entities that themselves fall within the \"jurisdiction\" of a territorial entity outside the bounds of \"normal\" territorial divisions such as transportation operators, school districts or Euroregions (as found in {{Q|243433}})?\n**The former may be appropriate, but the latter two are clear {{P|361}} to me.\n*If the original discussion was in fact about territorial courts, whyever is the current constraint strictly connected to political entities, causing problems whenever the division happens to be administrative instead (e.g. the Swedish {{Q|2065704}}, which show up in several places in the constraint report)?\n\nThe property could probably use at the very least a renaming (something along the lines of \"has jurisdiction within the territory of\") for clarity, and possibly a \"split\" for the \"governmental jurisdiction\" thing (\"is legislated by\" is not an option, sadly).

There are the reasons for the existence of Wikidata and the objectives of the Wikimedia Foundation as well.\n\n*The aim of the WMF is to share in the sum of all knowledge\n*The first purpose of Wikidata was to serve Wikipedia for its inter language links. Other projects followed; Wikiquote is the latest who is getting connected into Wikidata for its inter language links.\n*The second identified purpose is to provide as a source for data to be served in information boxes.\n\nQuality as a consequence can be measured by identifying to what extend it serves its purposes.\n==Interlanguage links for Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wikisource, Wikiquote==\nArguably this is where Wikidata shines. By centralising the information in one place updates are obvious and automatic. The number of interlanguage links [1] is increasing all the time. \n\nIf there is any concern, it is that many articles have not been identified as being of a same subject particularly when the languages involved are not one of the big ten or are in a different script.\n\n==Serving information==\n===Technical considerations===\n*When Wikidata is to provide the information that is currently in an infobox, all articles of a Wikipedia that include that info box require an item.\n*When an infobox is specific to a specific \"subclass\", every instance of that subclass needs an item. This means that we want to include the information as specified in that infobox never mind if that item has an article in a specific Wikipedia.\n===Human considerations===\n* As everybody works towards his or her own goals, the objectives differ and consequently the way success is measured. The statistics [1] show clearly that we slowly but surely add more statements and labels to more items. As a consequence, Reasonator [2] is becoming more informative on more subjects. \n* As success and therefore quality is understood in many ways, it is imperative to understand how quality can be measured and, how the different quality requirements stack up towards providing the service indicated above.\n* The objective of working towards quality is that we can agree how we must achieve our technical objectives and strive to include the personal objectives as well.\n==Measuring quality==\nWhen a community indicates an interest for it to use Wikidata for its information, there are several technical quantifiers involved. They are: \n*having an item for each article\n*having at least all the information that exists in all the info boxes\nUntil the moment when we actually serve that information, we need to continuously make sure that the information in Wikidata is compared with the information in that Wikipedia. Differences need to be identified and, a reconciliation process needs to be in place. Information in Wikidata can come from multiple sources so no source is obviously correct.\n\n==Sources and quality==\nObviously we want sources for each statement. The statistics show however that the data we have is piss poor [1]. With more than 50% of our items having none or one statement, we do not even identify most of our items for its subclass. Many Wikipedias, not all, have a requirement for sources. As it is, we do not / cannot harvest sources associated with statements from our Wikipedias. \n\nAs we value sources, an effort needs to be made to develop tools that harvest sources from Wikipedias. Given our current lack of data, adding only data with sources by hand is not feasible. Arguably, when we show that our data is of the same quality as our sources, the need for sources in Wikidata at this time is less pressing.\n\n==Comparing external sources with Wikidata==\nIn the WMF we have a history of sharing data with external sources. Of particular value are the processes where we identify differences to our partners. There are two kinds of differences: we or our partner lacks data and, the data differs between the two.\n:Arguably when we identify differences between the two data sets, we have a need for sources that decide the matter. \n:Arguably when we compare data, we make use of a database but we do not copy it. Consequently it can not be considered to be a copyright violation. \n:Arguably when a source indicates in its terms of use that we cannot compare its data with the data we have, it is not an open data source and it is debatable if we should link to it.\n\n==Measuring quality==\n*The statistics show that Wikidata is becoming more informative.\n*We can measure the quality of subsets of data, for instance the \"deaths of 2014\" is where Wikidata currently has more information than any Wikipedia.\n*When we work toward our goals, consideration should be given as to how we are progressing by using queries and statistics.\n\nThanks, [[User:GerardM|GerardM]] ([[User talk:GerardM|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 08:00, 10 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n*[1] [http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-todo/stats.php?reverse Wikidata stats]\n*[2] [http://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?&q=2013 Reasonator on Wikidata]\n{{dbot}}"

In my understanding WD has a ridiculously small number of properties compared to infobox parameters for several reasons: 1) we are acting as a black-box, just sucking data and not worrying about using it on Wikipedias, 2) the technical infrastructure to do that easily is not there yet (one of the blockers for the Visual Editor is this [[mw:Requests_for_comment/Associated_namespaces|RFC on mediawiki]], which takes some time to solve, but there are some more), 3) numbers with units are not there yet, 4) not all data is easily importable/usable because it was not created as structured data. I don't think we ever rejected any property proposal that was meant for importing a field from a Wikipedia template, unless it could be inferred from other properties, so it cannot be said that lowering the property creation requirements will result in more properties for infobox parameters.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 17:05, 28 April 2014 (UTC)\n*::: Mmm I don't see how a small field does not deserve the right to get a property. Relevance in not really big numbers ... And this does not change the fact that the proposer deserves an answer. Most voters would simply not knowing what they are talking about or just not interested, which just make their (un)vote not so relevant. Building structured data means beeing able to express the relationship beetween concepts. How does structuring datas in a small field is a problem in that scheme ? If we compare to ubilding infoboxes, people just create infoboxes as they want, they never had to ask support from the whole community. <span class=\"mw-code\" style=\"text-align:right; display: inline-block; padding: 0.1em;\">[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] <sup>([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]])</sup> </span> 17:18, 28 April 2014 (UTC)\n*:::: That is like the eternal discussion \"why cannot X have a Wikipedia page?\" and the answer is always provided by some sort of agreement about what is relevant.

For example is often proposals still opposed, based on that there is an inverse property describing the relation. Still, I have not seen any description of how the inverse relation is of any help on Wikipedia.

For example, it's used in FRBR to define the relationship between \"work\", \"expression\", \"manifestation\" and \"item\".  \n\nParticipants in this discussion should do some background research on ''part of'' before making any policy decisions regarding this property.  It is important to build on precedent and tie in with conventions.  Wikidata does not exist in a vacuum, and the question of how best to deal with part-whole relations is not new.  ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog1104_2/pdf A Taxonomy of Part-Whole Relations]'' by Chaffin and Hermann is a very widely-cited work on this.  They define six types of part-whole (i.e., \"meronymic\") properties:\n\n* Component/integral object.  Examples: handle-cup, punchline-joke\n* Member/collection.  Examples: tree-forest, card-deck\n* Portion/mass.  Examples: slice-pie, grain-salt\n* Stuff/object.  Examples: gin-martini, steel-bike\n* Feature/activity.  Examples: paying-shopping, dating-adolescence\n* Place/area.  Everglades/Florida, oasis-desert\n\nThe paper goes on to describe each of the subproperties of ''part of'' in detail.  We have a generic property for the \"Place/area\" subproperty -- {{P|276}}.  Readers may realize that we have quite a few analogs of ''located in''; see the [[Wikidata:Properties_for_deletion#event_location_.28P766.29|request for deletion of the ''event location'' property]] (P766) for perspective.\n\nAnother relevant publication on part-whole relations is in a W3C working note -- [http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/OEP/SimplePartWhole/ Simple part-whole relations in OWL Ontologies] -- by two prominent researchers in ontology / knowledge representation.  I recommend that those interested in this subject search around the web to see how part-whole relations are used in ontologies.  It would be best to have our policy be as non-unique to Wikidata as possible.  Let's familiarize ourselves and adopt with this subject and adopt conventions from the Semantic Web.

For example, don't put claims like \"{{P|527}} {{Q|332}}\" in {{Q|1}}. (Such statements are correct but clearly misplaced.) [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:29, 14 June 2014 (UTC)\n\n=== Improving 'member of' and 'consists of' ===\n\nTwo things have bothered me for a while about a couple of properties closely related to {{P|361}}.  First, the domain and range of {{P|463}} should be dropped.  That property should be a generic subproperty of ''part of'', where the only difference is that ''member of'' be non-transitive.  Second, since the main purpose of {{P|527}} is to be an inverse property of ''part of'', we should change the label of ''consists of'' to ''has part''.  The is pretty standard practice in ontologies; see [ftp://ftp.geneontology.org/go/www/GO.draft-page.shtml GO Ontology Relations] and [http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/OEP/SimplePartWhole/ Simple part-whole relations in OWL Ontologies] (hasPart). [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:40, 14 June 2014 (UTC)\n:We shouldn't be mixing issues, let's address first the \"part of\" refining and then we can take a look to \"member of\" - which also needs some depuration.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:06, 14 June 2014 (UTC)\n\n=== Comments on proposed divisions of 'part of' ===\n\nI am somewhat concerned that three of the six proposed divisions of ''part of'' are domain-specific: ''organic part of'', ''creative work part of'' and ''manufactured part of''.  I see no significant benefit from dividing 'part of' quite this way.  In particular, with ''organic part of'', this is not how part-whole relations are handled in biological or chemical ontologies.  For example, if you look in [ftp://ftp.geneontology.org/go/www/GO.draft-page.shtml GO Ontology Relations], you'll see a diagram of the statement \"mitochondrion ''part of'' cell\".  And in ChEBI, the reference ontology for biochemistry used in [http://www.obofoundry.org/ Open Biomedical Ontologies], you'll see that the [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=49637 ChEBI record on hydrogen] says \"hydrogen molecular entity ''has part'' hydrogen atom\", not ''has chemical part'' or some such.\n\nDividing ''part of'' along such superficial domain-specific lines would come at a significant cost.  Needing to learn special ways of simply saying \"this is a part of of that\" from one domain to the next is a barrier to entry for new users (or experienced users in a new domain).  The division also seems a bit arbitrary.  If we have ''organic part of'', then why not ''chemical part of'' to describe the same relation among chemicals, or ''geological part of'' among geological entities, or ''archaeological part of'' among archaeological entities? [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:11, 14 June 2014 (UTC)\n\n:They are not \"domain specific\", they are \"attribute specific\". Living beings have parts that grow, that evolve, and that in general follow a common pattern. Same for \"manufactured objects\". True that a creative work can be considered a \"manufactured object\", but for the sake of clarity I have divided them. A \"hydrogen molecular entity\" is an inert system composed of subsystems (hydrogen atoms).\n\n:To represent domain-specific parthood, a better way would be to use a qualifier \"type of part\", there you could add further details on how the part relates to the whole. It is not such a bad idea to use qualifiers, since we would need a way to indicate set-completeness or other characteristics of the relationship.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:44, 14 June 2014 (UTC)\n\n:: By the definition of \"domain-specific\" as used throughout the Semantic Web, literature on ontology, and discussions on Wikidata like this for well over a year, those properties would typically be called \"domain-specific\".  In addition to terms like \"attribute-specific\", your use of notions like \"subsystem\" seems novel.  Looking at your examples at top, what makes something like \"Jupiter\" a subsystem, but \"engine\" not a subsystem?  The Basic Formal Ontology (overview [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Project_chat/Archive/2013/12#BFO_2.0_.28draft.29 here]) provides a useful set of terms for discussing this type of thing, e.g. \"independent continuant\", \"material entity\", \"object aggregate\", etc.\n\n:: Can you further explain how you think ''part of'' is \"being used as a placeholder for too many possible meanings\"?  In a statement like \"beak ''part of'' bird\", surely users are not confusing a beak with a creative work or a manufactured thing like a cup.  Similarly, I don't think anyone is mistaking a cup handle as an organic thing.\n\n:: For reasons like that, I don't think domain-specific parthood is worth representing in a special way with properties like ''organic part of'' or ''part of'' with a qualifier ''type of part''.  Humans can almost always intuit and computers can automatically infer the domain by simply looking at the label, description, or using the item's {{P|31}} or {{P|279}} claim.

I am greatly in favour of dividing things, but the dimensions chosen here do not strike me as very intuitive. Here is what I would suggest:\n* '''Physical part of.''' A relationship between two concepts that describe things you can touch: A is a part of B if the atoms of B are a superset of the atoms of A. This subsumes the suggested \"organic part of\" and \"manufactured part of\". It also subsumes the example \"Africa-Earth\" from \"subsystem\".\n* '''Process/event part of.''' A relationship between two concepts that describe events or processes. \"Part of\" holds if the events that make up one of the concepts are also part of the events that make up the other concept. The example above is \"Third Punic War part of Punic wars\" and maybe also \"1397 part of 1380s\".\n* '''Metaphorical/figurative part of''' Abstract concepts that do not have a direct manifestation as physical objects or events may still be ''defined'' to consist of parts. This is natural when a physical/temporal relation is \"almost\" there: \"Chapter 1 is part of the book\" (if you print the book, the pages of Chapter 1 are a physical part of the book), \"The first movement of the symphony is part of the symphony\" (if you perform the piece, the events associated with the first movement are part of the events of the overall performance). This case covers the examples given under \"creative work\" above (I don't think that the idea is in any way specific to creative works though, e.g., \"adolescence is part of childhood\").\n\nIn addition, we often have complex concepts that are not a pure example of the above. In a general sense, hardly any human concept can be reduced to the set of its atoms (at least if you are slightly inclined towards idealism: a motorcycle is more than a collection of parts). We can still use \"part of\" to express a relation between the physical/process/... aspects of a concept even if there are more aspects around.\n\n'''This is where I would draw the line.''' All the other examples given above are not \"part of\" for me. The reason is that they are too abstract to allow for a clear understanding of the relationship that \"part of\" expresses. Let me illustrate by an example:\n* \"1 is part of the real numbers\"\n* \"The natural numbers are part of the real numbers\"\nWhich one is true? Both? In reality, these two are completely different relationships (element of a set vs. subset of a set). You might say: \"Let's just mix them -- no problem using a property in two ways.\" But the problem is that the two different meanings can occur for the same thing:\n* \"The natural numbers are part of the inifinite sets\"\nIt is completely clear to mathematicians that these things must not be confused. However, if you go to less formal disciplines, you can easily make the same confusion there without having a mathematician nearby that explains the error to you:\n* \"The Fellowship of the Ring is part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy\"\n* \"The Fellowship of the Ring is part of 20th century literature\"\nThe second is bogus to me, but it's really hard to tell for people, since \"part of\" is used so much in common language (only yesterday, I deleted \"landscape part of geography\"!). In fact, philosophy itself has suffered for most of its history from the recurring confusion of ''subset of'' and ''member of''.\n\nTo sum up, I would propose the following guidelines for part of:\n* It should only be used between two things of the same kind: two physical objects, two processes, two works of art, two groups of people.\n* It should not be used where more specific properties exist: material used, member of, instance of, subclass of, genre, ...\n* It should never be used for expressing something as vague as \"is often associated with\" or \"typically occurs together with\".\n\nIn general, \"part of\" to me seems to be an attempt to reduce the number of properties by merging properties of different meaning into one, simply because they can be called the same in English. Reuse is good, but mixing meanings is not. The many (non-agreeing) definitions of \"part of\" in semantic technologies and philosophy confirm that this is a likely issue here.\n\nI hope that my proposal can be the basis of a consensus, since it covers a large amount of different types of \"part of\" relationships, including the majority of the examples given here. I don't want to be extremist -- which would be to say that we need to have distinct properties for every aspect of \"part of\" -- I just want to draw the line where things become vague or contentious.\n\nFinally, thanks for initiating this important discussion. It is an important step towards a stable and clear use of part of.\n\nBest wishes,\n\n[[User:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch]] ([[User talk:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:20, 14 June 2014 (UTC)\n: I fully agree with this comment. <span class=\"mw-code\" style=\"text-align:right; display: inline-block; padding: 0.1em;\">[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] <sup>([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]])</sup> </span> 18:45, 14 June 2014 (UTC)\n\n:* [[User:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|Markus]], thanks for your thoughtful comment.

I would define it as  \"A relationship between two concepts that describe things related to each other by any of the fundamental forces\", that way we could use it for planetary systems, atomic systems, etc. and not just for sets of atoms in direct contact.\n::Also the label \"Metaphorical/figurative part of\" could give foot to misunderstandings, what about using a more unambiguous one like \"abstract part of\"?\n\n::All in all it seems that we are reaching some understanding of the properties that convey meaning from different points of view:\n::*classing: from the recurrence of similar instances, an idealized class is assumed.\n::*parthood/mereological: part-whole relationships for instances or classes\n::*sets: relations between collections of objects\n::*descriptive: attributes from an object or a class\n\n::Given your example of \"natural numbers\" and the fact that {{Q|21199}} is considered a \"subclass of:integer\", it suggests to me that we still don't have either the vocabulary nor the perceived need to work with sets, that is why there could be some confusion about how to relate such items.

How do major ontologies handle these things?  How are part-whole relations discussed in the literature of knowledge representation and ontology (especially formal ontologies in the Semantic Web)?  How can we build on the work of others?  \n\n: The [http://www.ontobee.org/browser/term.php?o=RO&iri=http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl%23ObjectProperty&graph=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/merged/RO OBO Relation Ontology] has many mereological properties.  Many of the properties are specific to biology, but many of them are generic, mereological, and would benefit Wikidata from considered.  The OBO Relation Ontology is tied into BFO, which is probably the most widely-used upper ontology.  It has ''part of'' and a ''part of'' subproperty for processes -- i.e. ''occurs in''.  ([[Wikidata:Project_chat/Archive/2013/12#BFO_2.0_.28draft.29|Processes are a type of event]]; events are \"[http://bfo.googlecode.com/svn/releases/2012-07-20-graz/BFO2-Reference-for-html.htm#_Toc204327840 occurants]\".) Wikidata has a very similar property which is up for deletion -- see [[Wikidata:Properties_for_deletion#event_location_.28P766.29]].  I would support changing the label of 'event location' to 'occurs in' (thus not deleting P766) and basing it on [http://www.ontobee.org/browser/rdf.php?o=RO&iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000066 BFO semantics for that property].\n\n: I am less sold on the worth of an ''metaphysical part of'' or ''abstract part of'' or otherwise specially metaphysical mereological relationship.  Can someone please give an example of a usage of such a property, why {{P|31}} or {{P|279}} would be inappropriate, and more importantly why {{P|361}} would not be appropriate?  Can someone provide an example of an external ontology using ''abstract part of'', or some knowledge representation or applied ontology literature on it?\n\n: As a side note, this talk of sets is interesting, given that the formal basis for {{P|31}} and {{P|279}} -- i.e. rdf:type and rdfs:subClassOf -- are the set theory relations  \u03f5 ([[:en:Element (mathematics)|element of]]) and \u2286 ([[:en:Subset|subset of]]), respectively.  Precisely speaking they're from description logic, but most of DL derives from set theory and first-order logic.

The taxonomist tells the bartender: \"After pouring so many gin&tonics in your life I am sure that you have an idealized class of gin-tonic in your mind, put me an instance of it\". The puzzled bartender serves him a gin&tonic. Then the merologist tells the bar tender: \"in that glass over there put 1/3 part of ice cubes, plus 1/3 part of gin and 1/3 part of tonic\". The happier bartender serves him that drink. And then the Wikidatan says: \"please, put me ''any'' drink but only if the recipe is sourced!\"\n\nWith that I don't mean that we should get drunk before writing here (other than of understanding and patience :)), just that sometimes it makes no sense to ask for a precedent. None of our properties is sourced because they are community minted concepts that might or might not find equivalents in the \"outer world\". Even for a field as rich in ontologies as bibliography, we just followed conventions where it made sense and when we could agree. So yes, we can take a look to external ontologies for inspiration, but not as a rule to follow or as a requirement to create properties.\n\n: Ha!  That may be the first Wikidata joke ever.  I'm glad it's a good one, and not some obscure [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#F12:_Punning pun] about treating classes as instances!  \n\n: That said, I think it is important to realize that Wikidata does not exist in a vacuum.  Many of our properties are sourced from the external world, including {{P|361}}.  This is indicated in their creation discussions, e.g. [[Wikidata:Property_proposal/Archive/4#P361]], or their talk page templates.  Same with {{P|279}}: it was first created based on a precedent from [[:en:CycL|CycL]], the '#$genls' property.  After community discussions like [[Property_talk:P31#is_a_-.3E_instance_of]], its basis was then substituted to be the analog of #$genls in OWL, rdfs:subClassOf.  That discussion was all about establishing a foundation for certain \"special\" properties based on Semantic Web conventions, and I think it has proven to be [http://korrekt.org/papers/Wikidata-RDF-export-2014.pdf quite fruitful].\n\n: I agree that we should not require properties to be based on external ontologies as a prerequisite for creation.  However, reviewing conventions in established vocabularies and the wider Semantic Web should be encouraged.  My concern in this particular discussion is that there seems to be much airy ontological opinionating without any real reference to outside literature or complementary footwork to see how ''part of'' and other mereological properties are used in actual, applied ontologies outside Wikidata.  \n\n: {{P|361}} is not a garden-variety property like {{P|569}} or {{P|509}}.  It is our most basic mereological membership property.  It is sometimes hard to differentiate from other [[Help:Basic_membership_properties|basic membership properties]], but it is widely useful, as evidenced by its ubiquity in Semantic Web ontologies.  Because of that special status of ''part of'', I think reviewing conventions in the Semantic Web on its semantics, usage and subproperties is something that should be very encouraged. \n\n: I will not be able to devote more time to this discussion for the next few weeks.  While I would oppose the deletion of {{P|361}} and have reservations about some aspects of what's been proposed, I am glad that we are discussing how to improve our practices with part-whole relations.

How to signal to users which uses are acceptable and which not? You can manually patrol all edits, or use labels/aliases that hint the restricted uses of the property, or use distinct concepts that allow you to convey better the meaning and perhaps check if the relationship is correct.\n\n:Manually patrolling the edits is what we are doing now, and it is not very effective. For instance yesterday I replaced {{C|Q907|P361|Q279744}} by {{C|Q907|P1080|Q279744}}, not a big deal, but if we had had a way of detecting that outlier, it would have been corrected much faster. Or if the property p1080 wouldn't have been there, then we would have been known that is needed.\n\nMy lines of reasoning here are:\n*unclear defined property/label->ambiguous uses->not possible to check for correctness->more difficult to maintain\n*clear defined property/label->unequivocal uses->possible to check for correctness->easier to maintain\n\n:: [[User:Micru|Micru]], the example mistakes that prompt Markus to \"draw the line\" are classic confusions between hyponymy (''instance of'', ''subclass of'') and meronymy (''part of'').  They violate a simple rule: if \"A is a B\" satisfies the relation between A and B, then \"A {{P|361}} B\" is incorrect.\n:: It is important to distinguish between a statement being incorrect and unideal.  ''Part of'' statements like \"Neptune ''part of'' universe\" are correct, just not ideally placed.  Similarly, your example of \"Gordon Freeman ''part of'' Half-Life\" is also correct, but perhaps too general.  Both statements could be phrased better (e.g. \"Neptune ''part of'' Solar System), but they are correct, i.e. true.\n:: I support using statements like \"Gordon Freeman ''from narrative or fictional universe'' Half-Life\" instead of \"Gordon Freeman ''part of'' Half-Life\".  This is not the same as supporting subproperties like ''abstract part of'', ''physical part of'', etc.  The former allows us to be more expressive and solves problematic ambiguity; the latter doesn't seem to.

Perhaps we don't need more specific properties, just more specific guidelines, which might be an even bigger challenge.

Looking closer I see that [http://www.ontobee.org/browser/rdf.php?o=RO&iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000066 'occurs in' is not a subproperty of 'part of'].

There is a sonata with 3 parts, the whole sonata is a creative work, each part is a creative work, the relationship between the parts and the whole is abstract. You can model it with classes, but it will only get confusing and more difficult to maintain (source: I tried).\n: Why is {{P|361}} insufficient to describe parts of a creative work?

Which one is correct? It doesn't matter as long as you are aware of the method you are using for interpreting reality (or ''[[P:P248|stated in]]'' reality, for that matter). For man-made objects/concepts we could assume that the person modeled first a prototype of, say, [[Q1463050|Tesla Model S]], and then they created instances out of it. But for naturally occurring concepts, like [[Q74314|titin]], reality has precedence and our class is modeled after observing repeated occurrences of it.\n\nThis subtle difference wouldn't matter much if it were not for the fact that we deal with both worlds, the mind-created world of (semantic web, mathematic) ontologies and the mind-created world of inferring reality, and sometimes for the sake of clarity we need to tell them apart, even if, deep in ourselves, we know that both of them are mind constructs.\n\nFor that reason I think it is a good idea to use \"subclass of\" ambiguously to represent both, but when we need to refer to specifically one realm, then we need might need a way to get rid of the ambiguity.\n\n: I agree that ''subclass of'' should be used to represent both interpretations, to simply ensure that items A and B related with it satisfy the statement \"every instance of A is an instance B\".  I would prefer to keep ''subclass of'' neutral in the matter of philosophical ontology you describe, which seems like it might be somewhat of a personal perspective on the nature of classes.

This is very bad and to be avoided. \n\nGiven that Wikidata is connected to many external sources, there will be sources among them that do split \"is part of\" in the suggested way.

This always made be think, now is the time and occasion to discuss this probably :) I'm reluctant to accept that, probably because this make more likely that there could introduce ambiguities about what is a class and what is an instance. Following the token/class distinction, this imply that we have the same relation to say that an individual is a component of another individual, and that a class of individual instances are each probably a part of the instances of another class of individual.\n\nThis strikes me especially about virtual objects, such as for example the ''Snow White'' story. It can be seen as a class of events in which someone tells this story to a children. Then the part of the story where Snow White eats the Apple has been told many time, for example the premiere of Walt Disney's movie. It ''happened'' on this premiere. <The part where Snow White eats the Apple on Walt Disney's premiere> is a part of <Walt Disney's Snow White premiere>, as a token of the experience of the people that were here. \n\nIt seems to me that using the same property both for tokens and classes in the sense of the token/class relationship introduce problems an ambiguities, for example in the cases where we use punning and in which a story is both a token of some story or some book and a class of all the tokens where this story has been told ... any thoughts ?\n\n:[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]], after reflecting about it, I don't see it problematic as long as an instance is \"part of\" another instance, and a class is \"part of\" another class.

Not totally sure that works though. \n:: It seems problematic in the sense that we got a clear rule for instances : every A-instance is allowed to be a part of a B-instance if and only if, roughly, they are both of the same classification : an event can't be part of an object. If we want to reflect that at the class level it may need to reason at the metaclass level : a class A can be a part of a class B if and only if they have some superclass in common which is compatible ? The ''Class'' class could work, but it does not seem to be a hard condition to meet. It has a reflection at the metaclass level : a class A can be a part of a class B if they have the same type of class. But all of this needs a little bit of thinking.\n:: By the way I realize it may be not so easy for the part of relationship at the instance level as well. Maybe we should need to list the cases for which there is constraint for an item of some class to be a part of another. We could need a way to state that physical objects can be composited, but physical object cannot be composited with event instances ... <span class=\"mw-code\" style=\"text-align:right; display: inline-block; padding: 0.1em;\">[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] <sup>([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]])</sup> </span> 21:11, 29 June 2014 (UTC)\n\n:::[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]], I realized that the only difference between \"part of\" and \"subclass of\" is their similarity to the containing set.

Of course those limits are subjective and we'll have to struggle with them. There must be some way to calculate the distance between elements using either \"part of\", \"subclass of\", and \"instance of\", because they all represent that an entity belongs to a set, with different degrees of similarity. If we had a mathematical distance measure, that could help to point to calculate what are the average limits for \"part of\" and \"subclass of\" and from there identify outliers.

I don't really understand where your are going. {{Part of|my skull|my boby}} does not make <my body> a class at all, it's very different. <my body> and <mu skull> are not sets, they are real world entities. There classes although have a least common superclass, which seems like your ''upper limit''. When we say <skull> part of <body> though we say something different : every skull instance is a part of a body. The composition constraint would impose that those two classes have a least common superclass that can be composed of other objects of the same class. A biological entity, for example, could be composed of other biological entity. Here come another interpretation of the relationship beetween class, I realize : by stating <class A> part of <class B>, we may allow A instances to be part of B instances.

For example, {{P|1340}} can be considered mereological -- eye color is part of all humans (except for rare cases where one has no eyes).  So for example instead of saying {{Q|45661}} {{P|1340}} {{Q|17244894}}, we could paraphrase this as \"Coco Chanel ''has part'' dark brown eyes\" or perhaps how [[User:Marsupium|Marsupium]] states it in more complex fashion [[Wikidata:Property_proposal/Archive/23#P1340|here]].  This is based on the reading of ''has part'' as a liberal ''has-a'' property.  Of course, just like {{P|31}} can be abused to paraphrase away almost all properties (Coco Chanel ''instance of'' dark-brown-eyed person, also explored [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Wikidata:Properties_for_deletion&oldid=141164871#type_of_administrative_entity_.28P132.29 here]), so can ''part of'' and ''has part''.  Both of these abuses should be avoided.\n\nAt the same time, that potential for abuse does not mean {{P|31}} or {{P|361}} should be deprecated.  Again, ''part of'' is a ubiquitous property in Semantic Web ontologies.  It is widely used in [ftp://ftp.geneontology.org/go/www/GO.draft-page.shtml Gene Ontology] and [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:49637 ChEBI], two major biomedical ontologies that serve as unofficial benchmarks of OWL.  It is used as a motivating example in new features in OWL 2, e.g. the useful idea of [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#F8:_Property_Chain_Inclusion property chain inclusion].\n\nUnlike ''instance of'', which has some special restrictions that prevent subproperties of it from being valid, it does make sense to have certain subproperties of ''part of''.  {{P|276}} is a good example (though it needs refinement): it's rigorously defined in BFO (e.g. [http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/#OBO_REL:located_in here]) and used as a motivating example for property chain inclusions in OWL 2.  However, this does not automatically imply that subproperties like \"physical part of\", \"abstract part of\", etc. are a good idea.  While subproperties like ''located in'' fulfill a clear need and also, importantly, have precedent in major existing ontologies, I see neither of those criteria met by the subproperties of ''part of'' proposed by Micru or Markus.\n\nThe discussion of the relation between of ''subclass of'' and ''part of'' would benefit from being cast in terms of OWL.  For example, OWL allows us to form sentences using [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#Boolean union, intersection and complement] from set theory -- i.e. OR, AND, and NOT Boolean operators.  These could function as the \"plus\" operator that TomT0m refers to.  We can also use [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#Object_Property_Cardinality_Restrictions object property cardinality restrictions] to say that a human hand has part human finger with cardinality 5.  It's unclear to me how we avoid someone with an amputated ring finger from being said to not have a human hand (and thus not be human).  A test case for this is {{Q|373274}}, who has a partially amputated foot.  Being able to make exceptions to rules, like \"humans have eye color\" or \"humans have two feet with five toes each\", is important.  This requires \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-nonmonotonic/ non-monotonic]\" reasoning. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 03:59, 1 July 2014 (UTC)\n\n:[[User:Emw|Emw]], thanks for your comments. You forgot to mention that also \"subclass of\" can be abused, but well, let's not give more bad ideas ;) For cardinality we already have {{p|P1164}}, I just used it for {{Q|33767}}. Non-monotonic logic is more appropriate for capturing deviations than FOL, but still you need to model in which way something can deviate from the norm (class), and which consequences it has. In that regard I noticed in ChEBI that they use \"has role\", which is exactly what I was thinking about. We only have {{P|366}}, and with that label it seems more appropriate for usable objects than for parts of a system. By having the role, when an instance misses it, you also know in which way the whole is impaired (it will have access to less roles).\n\n:Wrt ''part of'' I must say that now I'm more inclined to use qualifiers or just properties to clarify part-whole relations. For instance we don't know in which way the part is connected to the whole (gravity? organic tissue?), or if that part can be separated and still keeps its role (integral? proper?). It is also difficult to express which position the part has respect the whole. In BFO this is done with several properties, not just located in, there is also: contained in, adjacent to, etc.\n\n:I'm totally in support of boolean operators, but one cannot just let them loose in wikidata and expect that they are used. It will not happen unless they are properly explained and perhaps made easier resorting to common language. For instance a good way to start with this would be to introduce \"misses\" (equivalent to NOT). A person can miss a foot, a building can miss a window, and that makes it much easier to understand for lay people while keeping OWL compatibility.\n\n:Same applies to property chain inclusion, very nice on paper, but until we don't find practical ways to use it and explain it, it is useless.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 08:20, 1 July 2014 (UTC)\n\n:: [[User:Micru|Micru]], great comment.  Regarding cardinality, if we want to use [[P:P1164|cardinality of the group <small>(P1164)</small>]] to indicate ''exact'' cardinality ''beyond'' the domain of {{Q|1057968}}, then we should change its label and domain to be closer to the corresponding property in OWL -- i.e. we should relabel it to \"[http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_ObjectExactCardinality exact cardinality]\" and remove its domain and range.  It would then also make sense to create properties for \"max. cardinality\" and \"min. cardinality\".\n\n:: And regarding [[P:P366|use <small>(P366)</small>]], its label as \"use\" does not suggest to me that it is \"more appropriate for usable objects than for parts of a system\".  Further, the dichomtomy implied there -- that \"usable objects\" are disjoint with \"parts of a system\" -- is not supported by any upper ontologies I'm aware of, including most notably BFO, and doesn't seem especially warranted.  Beyond that, though, I do think the property is useful along the lines you suggest.  I think it would help to more closely align its label with BFO, i.e. to change \"use\" to \"has role\".  (While we're at it, we should probably also create an inverse property for it, i.e. \"role of\".).\n\n:: I agree that it often helps to clarify part-whole relations, especially in ways that align with existing major ontologies.  I would strongly favor doing so with just properties, and not through qualifiers, because [[Wikidata:Development_plan#Simple_queries|qualifiers will not be queryable]] in the foreseeable future and existing ontologies tend to not use n-ary relations (the purpose of qualifiers).  So for example I would support properties like ''proper part of'', ''contained in'' and ''adjacent to'', assuming they had the semantics defined in BFO.  ''[http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R46 Relations in biomedical ontologies]'' by Smith et al. provides a good basis.  (Despite the paper's title it is relevant well beyond biomedicine.)\n\n:: Introducing new special concepts like cardinality and Boolean operators would be very useful.  Introducing [[:en:Universal quantification|universal quantification]] and [[:en:Existential quantification|existential quantification]], supported in OWL as [http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/#allValuesFrom owl:allValuesFrom] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/#someValuesFrom owl:someValuesFrom], would also be very useful.  Incorporating these concepts into Wikidata would have effects on the computational complexity of the ontology worth considering, but they would greatly increase how expressive we can be.  A major question is how these concepts could be captured on Wikidata: overloading qualifiers to handle them might be a grievous kludge.  These things are of course not directly related to refining \"part of\", but may make sense to consider in a separate RFC while they're fresh in mind.

For example ''located in'' is really a subproperty of ''part of'' ? It might be sometimes, but for example an airplane just stationned somewhere is probably not imho a part of an airport. Class intersection, complements and so on are great, but I'm not sure how it is really related to part of (execpt if you want to state that an a body can have some part like 'arm', where 'arm' is the union of too classes : 'artificial arm' and 'natural arm'. But its related to class definitions, not really ''part of''. I agree that watching the number of exceptions on [[Property_talk:P225]] for example, a non monotonic logic would be cool, but I think we're far from having really explored the full potential of the FOL model. {{Ping|Emw}} On the OWL modeling properties : I think the way we store them is the least important problem, the biggest one is a usability problem. There is no way I really model something like class expressions in Wikidata actually creating statements for each model of the class, this is really tedious compared to using syntaxes like Manchester syntax, for example. Plus we need to make this simple and understandable for users. It's not obvious at all. <span class=\"mw-code\" style=\"text-align:right; display: inline-block; padding: 0.1em;\">[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] <sup>([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]])</sup> </span> 18:06, 1 July 2014 (UTC)\n\n::::[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]], when something it is a physical part of a whole, then it is useful to know what is the position of one with respect to the other. It is not about ''located in'' being a subproperty or not, it is more about expressing the position of the part wrt the whole, or another significant part of it. And that plus size can really help us to identify misplaced parthood.\n::::When we are entering that a class is ''part of'' another, we are also defining ''expectations'' (we expect that the class human has a foot) and then we can define something as how it breaks those expectations ({{Q|373274}} <misses part> foot). Or that it fulfills them in a different way (x <has part> artificial arm).\n::::Now replying to [[User:Emw|Emw]], I don't think an ''exact'' cardinality is what we need, just a \"cardinality\" which depending on the context it will be considered to be exact, or it will have upper and lower limit. No need for \"min\" and \"max\", since the quantity datatype already supports limits. And I am not sure we could do without qualifiers because that would imply having intermediary items (finger group of one hand <cardinality> 5), which would make the editing process too tedious. However, the first step to improve usability should be to simplify the language. Instead of using \"cardinality of the group\" as a general cardinality property, we can reserve that one for mathematics and have a more generic one called \"number of parts\" (similar to {{p|1114}}).\n::::There is not going to be range restrictions, the closest we have is the [[template:Constraint|constraints templates]] and perhaps it will be hard to translate all of them into statements (at least not the exceptions, too many). Besides there is the new suggester, which apparently will work with values too. That can be more effective.\n::::Whatever new property we propose it should be in the terms of what users understand/expect.

Unlike [[User:Micru|Micru]], I think this is significant.  Let's consider the formal instance-level definitions of those two properties in ''[http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R46 Relations in Biomedical Ontologies]''.  The paper lays the foundation for the usage of ''part of'', ''located in'', and other basic properties throughout all domain ontologies rooted in the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO, [[Wikidata:Project_chat/Archive/2013/12#BFO_2.0_.28draft.29|outlined here]]), including Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI), Gene Ontology (GO), the [http://books.google.com/books?id=XYOBAusxPCcC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=bfo+ontology&source=bl&ots=4nFYXvfaMy&sig=xq4BZAmY8DH0J5DMj3DE_xB4Fes&hl=en&ei=ZFpjStvADMaltgem27SyAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2#v=onepage&q=bfo%20ontology&f=false Petrochemical Ontology], the [https://code.google.com/p/emotion-ontology/ Emotion Ontology], and many others.\n\n: '''c part_of c1 at t''' - a primitive relation between two continuant instances and a time at which the one is part of the other\n\n: '''p part_of p1, r part_of r1''' - a primitive relation of parthood, holding independently of time, either between process instances (one a subprocess of the other), or between spatial regions (one a subregion of the other) \n\n: '''c located_in r at t''' - a primitive relation between a continuant instance, a spatial region which it occupies, and a time\n\nFor clarity, let's examine precisely what is meant by \"continuant\", \"process\" and \"spatial region\":\n\n: The terms 'continuant' and 'process' are generalizations of GO's 'cellular component' and 'biological process' but applied to entities at all levels of granularity, from molecule to whole organism. Continuants are those entities which endure, or continue to exist, through time while undergoing different sorts of changes, including changes of place. Processes are entities that unfold themselves in successive temporal phases [16]. The terms 'continuant' and 'process' thus correspond to what, in the literature of philosophical ontology, are known respectively as 'things' (objects, endurants) and 'occurrents' (activities, events, perdurants) respectively. A continuant is what changes; a process is the change itself. The continuant classes relevant to biological ontologies include ''molecule'', ''cell'', ''membrane'', ''organ''; the process classes include ''ion transport'', ''cell division'', ''fat body development'', ''breathing''.\n\n: Note that continuants and processes form non-overlapping categories. This means in particular that no subtype or parthood relations cross the continuant-process divide. The tripartite structure of the GO recognizes this categorical exclusivity and extends it to functions also.\n\n: Continuants can be ''material'' (a mitochondrion, a cell, a membrane), or ''immaterial'' (a cavity, a conduit, an orifice), and this, too, is an exclusive divide. Immaterial continuants have much in common with spatial regions [18]. They are distinguished therefrom, however, in that they are parts of organisms, which means that, like material continuants, they move from one spatial region to another with the movements of their hosts.\n\n: The three-dimensional continuants that are our primary focus here typically have a top and a bottom, an anterior and a posterior, an interior and an exterior. Processes, in contrast, have a beginning, a middle and an end. Processes, but not continuants, can thus be partitioned along the time axis, so that, for example, your youth and your adulthood are temporal parts of that biological process which is your life.\n\n: As child and adult are continuants, so youth and adulthood are processes. We are thus clearly dealing here with two complementary - space-focused and time-focused - views of the same underlying subject matter, with determinate logical and ontological connections between them [16]. The framework advanced below allows us to capture these connections by incorporating reference to spatial regions and to temporal instants, both of which can be thought of as special kinds of instances.\n\n: We shall also need to distinguish two kinds of instance-level relations: those (applying to continuants) whose representations must involve a temporal index, and those (applying to processes) which do not.  Note that the drawing of this distinction is still perfectly consistent with the fact that processes themselves occur in time, and that processes may be built out of successive subprocesses instantiating distinct classes.\n\nIn addition to instance-level relations defined above, the paper goes on to describe class-level relations for each basic property.  Here is its eludication of ''part of'', which corresponds with some key things we've established in this RFC:\n\n: '''Part_of'''\n\n: '''Parthood as a relation between instances.''' The primitive instance-level relation p part_of p1 is illustrated in assertions such as: this instance of ''rhodopsin mediated phototransduction'' part_of this instance of ''visual perception''.\n\n: This relation satisfies at least the following standard axioms of mereology: reflexivity (for all p, p part_of p); anti-symmetry (for all p, p1, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p then p and p1 are identical); and transitivity (for all p, p1, p2, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p2, then p part_of p2). Analogous axioms hold also for parthood as a relation between spatial regions.\n\n: For parthood as a relation between continuants, these axioms need to be modified to take account of the incorporation of a temporal argument. Thus for example the axiom of transitivity for continuants will assert that if c part_of c1 at t and c1 part_of c2 at t, then also c part_of c2 at t.\n\n: '''Parthood as a relation between classes.''' To define part_of as a relation between classes we again need to distinguish the two cases of continuants and processes, even though the explicit reference to instants of time now falls away. For continuants, we have C part_of C1 if and only if any instance of C at any time is an instance-level part of some instance of C1 at that time, as for example in: cell nucleus part_ of cell.\n\n: Formally:\n\n: C part_of C1 = [definition] for all c, t, if Cct then there is some c1 such that C1c1t and c part_of c1 at t.\n\n: Note the 'all-some' structure of this definition, a structure which will recur in almost all the relations treated here.\n\n: C part_of C1 defines a relational property of permanent parthood for Cs. It tells us that Cs, whenever they exist, exist as parts of C1s. We can also define in the obvious way C temporary_part_of C1 (every C exists at some time in its existence as part of some C1) and also C initial_part_of C1 (every C is such that it begins to exist as part of some instance of C1).\n\n: For processes, we have by analogy, P part_of P1 if and only if any instance of P is an instance-level part of some instance of P1, as for example in: ''M phase'' part_of ''cell cycle'' or ''neuroblast cell fate determination'' part_of ''neurogenesis''. Formally:\n\n: P part_of P1 = [definition] for all p, if Pp then there is some p1 such that: P1p1 and p part_of p1.\n\n: An assertion to the effect that P part_of P1 thus tells us that Ps in general are in every case such as to exist as parts of P1s. P1s themselves, however, may exist without having Ps as parts (consider: menopause part_of aging).\n\n: Note that part_of is in fact two relations, one linking classes of continuants, the other linking classes of processes. While both of the mentioned relations are transitive, this does not mean that part_of relations could be inferred which would cross the continuant-process divide.\n\nReturning to the topic at hand, we see that ''part of'' is used in these ontologies to link both \"physical\" and \"abstract\" things with the same property, without a special qualifier to indicate whether its subject and object are physical or abstract.  \n\nThe elucidation above also supports and refines some constraints on ''part of'' we have been vaguely approaching.  We have discussed items linked by ''part of'' should \"have some superclass in common\".  However, as TomT0m notes in the preceding section, ''part of'' should not be used to link \"objects\" and \"events\".  In BFO parlance, \"objects\" are \"continuants\" and \"events\" are \"occurents\".  \n\nFor interoperability with major existing ontologies and firm philosophical grounding, I think it would be best to refine ''part of'' along the lines used in BFO. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 12:39, 2 July 2014 (UTC)\n\n:[[User:Emw|Emw]], I don't think anyone here suggested mixing parthood of objects with events, quite the opposite (or if someone did I cannot find it). The text you copied is more or less what we have been discussing here, just in more formal terms.

P1s themselves, however, may exist without having Ps as parts'', reaffirms my impression that we need a property to indicate when an instance is missing a part, because it is assumed that it has all of them unless indicated otherwise.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:16, 2 July 2014 (UTC)\n\n:: [[User:Micru|Micru]], BFO's parthood definition accounts for \"abstract parts of abstract wholes\" by simply using ''part of'' between two classes.  For example, in the statement \"cell_nucleus ''part_of'' cell\" in the paper, both 'cell nucleus' and 'cell' are abstract: they are universals (classes), not particulars (instances).  \n\n:: Same with \"big left toe ''part of'' left foot\": 'big left toe' and 'left foot' are abstract things.  They are subclasses of [[Wikidata:Project_chat/Archive/2013/12#BFO_2.0_.28draft.29|material entity]], but do not refer to a particular material entity, i.e. physical thing.  Contrast that with \"Eric Shinseki's big left toe ''part of'' Eric Shinseki's left foot\", which is how BFO and those major ontologies would capture the proposed \"physical part of\" property.  'Eric Shinseki's big left toe' would be an instance of 'toe', but it would be an unconventional separation of concerns to state whether his big toe is a class or instance in the {{P|361}}  property when we already have a way to state that with {{P|31}} and {{P|279}}.\n\n:: While BFO does not use subproperties of ''part of'' to indicate a subject's abstract-physical (class-instance, type-token) nature, it does use them to indicate its upper classification.  These can be seen by opening http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/core-relations.owl in [http://protege.stanford.edu/ Protege]. \n\n:: Regarding how to state that something is not part of something, I am inclined to prefer a more generic property than \"misses part\" (which I'd label \"does not have part\" if I were to support it).  Instead of a property-specific negation, as a first approach I would prefer a generic ''not'' property, to be used as a qualifier on any statement in need of simple negation.  This would function as a way to capture OWL's owl:complementOf, owl:datatypeComplementOf, owl:NegativePropertyAssertion and NegativeDataPropertyAssertion in one Wikidata property: ''not''.  More on negation in OWL is here: http://dior.ics.muni.cz/~makub/owl/#negative.  The advanced negations there would likely require some way to enter complex statements (e.g. in Manchester syntax) on an item's Talk page, but the simple negations there could probably be achieved through the current UI.

I was referring to purely abstract relationships like \"monarch (the office) <part of> monarchy\" or \"algebra <part of> mathematics\". Are they considered processes too?\n\n::: Before suggesting the property \"not\", please think about which use cases you might have, because I think there are not that many. Consider also what is the difference between the possible use cases and the rank \"no value\" option.

See the 'Role' section on page 3 of [http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1941/version/1/files/npre20081941-1.pdf#3 Function, Role, and Disposition in Basic Formal] by Robert Arp and Barry Smith for a fuller explanation.  Going back to a previous critique of yours against a putative property labeled \"has role\", I would note that similar niche concerns have been raised about {{P|279}} -- e.g. that it would confuse biological taxonomists because \"subclass\" is a taxonomic rank, and thus should be avoided in biological taxonomy.  \n\n:::: I find both arguments uncompelling and detrimental to interoperability.  With ''subclass of'', it makes a large portion of our ontology inconsistent with the rest because of concerns that [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/NCBITAXON/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FNCBITaxon_9606&jump_to_nav=true existing reference ontologies of biological taxonomy] have moved beyond.  With ''has role'', it prevents us from aligning a separate ''has function'' property as used by major BFO ontologies like ChEBI.  \n\n:::: Regarding a ''not'' qualifier, it would be different from the built-in \"no value\" option by enabling specific values to be negated.   ''Not'' would be used to enable simple negation for all statements.  For example, it would subsume ''does not have part''.  It could also be used to negate more specific statements, e.g. \"vegetarian ''diet'' not meat\", \"\"shipwreck {{P|366}} not sailing\", \"Barack Obama {{P|P19}} not Kenya\", \"autism {{P|P828}} not MMR vaccine\", etc.  The latter two are subtly but importantly different than [[Wikidata:Glossary#Rank|deprecated rank]] in that deprecated statements would have erroneous references per the documentation, while negated statements would have reliable sources making the claim.\n\n:::: Finally, regarding your point about assertions vs. claims: citation needed.  The distinction you note seems derive from your personal definition of those terms.  Wikidata claims, which when combined with references comprise a [[Wikidata:Glossary#Statement|statement]], are exactly synonymous with assertions, at least in the sense of knowledge representation, which is the relevant context here. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 03:57, 7 July 2014 (UTC)\n\n::::: [[User:Emw|Emw]], and what about \"algebra <part of> mathematics\"? Should we address it with another property?\n\n::::: It is not detrimental to have more specific properties than other sites. For instance, our {{p|171}} can be mapped to an external \"subclass of\", either directly or indicating that \"parent taxon\" <subproperty of> \"subclass of\". The label of the property is not as important as its use, and you have to bear in mind that whatever property is going to be used by people. It doesn't matter much if the name is the same or different as long as it makes the property easier to understand and to use. Just propose the property, and if there are concerns then anyone can propose an alternative label.\n\n::::: I understand your point about the \"not\", it might have some application. I just hope it will be a bit more used than {{P|1011}}.\n\n::::: Assertions vs. claims: theoretically we don't produce any knowledge representation, we aggregate them, that means that we could collect from different sources any assertion that is conflicting with any existing one. Even with you equating statements and assertions, I don't see any point to call \"assertion\" to something that is not \"asserted\" (i.e. declared true and the effects of this spread through the system). Claims, of course, become assertions as soon as you integrate them into a reasoning system and you declare them true in a given context, which implies bringing coherence (subjectivity) to the data. This distinction doesn't derive from any personal definition, but from applying a phenomenological approach, which is better suited to the diversity that Wikidata aims to represent.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 12:40, 7 July 2014 (UTC)\n\n===Crossing the continuant-process divide===\nAccording to the paper \"Relations in Biomedical Ontologies\" posted above by [[User:Emw|Emw]], ''continuants and processes form non-overlapping categories. This means in particular that no subtype or parthood relations cross the continuant-process divide''. That is a great limit for parthood, but still, there are concepts that do not cross the divide, but combine it. For instance, it could be said that {{q|5}} ''combines'' {{Q|3769299}} and {{Q|Q23852}} (cf. {{P|971}}). No idea if there is a way in to express this in BFO terms.\n\nThat could be represented with a new property, but what happens when this \"combined\" class is instanced? It can get confusing. Analyzing the concept of {{Q|571}}, it can be seen as a combination of a physical support (continuant) and the information it contains (process?). When it is instanced it could be understood as:\n# the new item represents only the immaterial part (information)\n# the new item represents only the material part (ink on paper)\n# the new item represents an instance of both the \"creative work\" and of \"bundle of pages\" (single book)\n# the new item represents an instance/class of a \"creative work\" and a class of \"bundle of pages\" (book edition)\n# the new item represents an instance/class of a \"creative work\" and a class of \"bundle of pages\" (class of all editions)\nAll these possibilities have confused me in the past because they combine two domains, and sometimes at different abstraction levels (class and instance). It is clear that when we add a part to any of these combinations, we are acting on both domains. A chapter is both a physical entity (pages) and the information contained within, that is why it can be part of a book. It is unlikely that one item that combines domains could appear as only one of them in real life (cases 1 and 2 above), although they can exist in the theoretical domain.\n\nWith all this I want to point out that besides parts of continuants and parts of processes, there is a third case when both happen in combination. In those cases, the part must also represent a combination of both, and if it is not it can be assumed that only affects one of the domains the item is a combination of.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:02, 4 July 2014 (UTC)\n: Hehe, soon you'll ask yourself if life is a process :). I think physical entities are involded in processes. Arguably for example, if  the life of Karl Marx is a process, let's call this a biography, then Karl Marx's body is involved in it. I think this is not a case of obvious whole/part relationship : is Karl Marx a whole with parts <Karl Marx body> and <Karl Marx Biography> ? I don't think so. There is a really tight relationship beetween them, arguably they are several viewpoints on the same object. <span class=\"mw-code\" style=\"text-align:right; display: inline-block; padding: 0.1em;\">[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] <sup>([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]])</sup> </span> 16:05, 4 July 2014 (UTC)\n\n::[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]], I don't think either that <Karl Marx body> and <Karl Marx Biography> have a parthood relationship to <Karl Marx>, there is a deeper connection. It can be said that both <Karl Marx body> and <Karl Marx Biography> are a {{P|1269}} <Karl Marx>, however that property misses the point that the one cannot exist without the other, and that they are totally integrated without possibility of separation. According to formal ontologies one could say that <Karl Marx Biography> \"has participant\" <Karl Marx body>, and perhaps <Karl Marx body> \"has agent\" <Karl Marx Biography>, but again, that seems a convoluted way to express their shared existence and it doesn't convey the \"for A and B to exist, both A and B *have* to happen co-dependently to each other\".

I'll make a couple very brief comments since I'm on a deadline, and hope to return to it 1 Feb.\n* \"Part of\" is strongly related to \"instance of\" and \"subclass of\", at least because people often confuse them. The same distinction has appeared in Taxonomies/Thesauri. [[:w:en:ISO 25964]], the latest standard on Thesauri, distinguishes 3 kinds of \"broader\" relations: broaderGeneric (similar to \"subclass of\"), broaderPartitive (\"part of\"), broaderInsantial (\"instance of\"). Unfortunately in the current OWL rendition (http://purl.org/iso25964/skos-thes) all these are subproperties of skos:broader thus mixed together in skos:broaderTransitive. See presentation [http://vladimiralexiev.github.io/pres/20140912-NKOS-compositionality/index.html On Compositionality of ISO 25964 Hierarchical Relations (BTG, BTP, BTI)] and a [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7BFygWDV2_PNkQycHl0bWNLak0 draft paper] for counter-examples and a proposal which sub-kind is composable with which other ones.\n* Philosophy has been dealing with these topics for centuries, in disciplines such as ontology (but not the simplified kind in Semantic Web) and mereology. To discount philosophical achievements means to lapse into ad-hoc and brittle structures that won't work.\n* Since Wikidata wants to structure all knowledge, we're hitting all kinds of exceptions and corner cases. In other words, the \"thought experiments\" of philosophers and ontologists are now finding a large and real experimental ground.\n* To design good approaches, we need to be '''both''' aware of (or even experts in) the fundamental philosophical achievements, and temper with practical considerations (eg whether a common editor will understand and apply consistently whatever guidelines come out of these discussions).\n** Understanding the different natures (or sub-kinds of) \"part of\" relations is essential, since that affects transitivity. You can't always compose different sub-kinds. This is a major subject of study in mereology.\n** I hope not all of us would have to read philosophical treatises (eg the excellent article \"Mereology\" in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) but at least we need to be aware of some examples and counter-examples.\n* [http://cidoc-crm.org/ CIDOC CRM] (ISO 21127, [[:w:en:CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model]]) is a fundamental ontology that deals with creative works, the process of creation (eg a painter Creating an image in his mind, then Producing a painting, which can then be re-Produced numerous times), lifecycle (eg Production, Modification, Destruction), historic events, etc. You can see the class hierarchy (and graphical illustrations of structures for typical usages) eg at http://personal.sirma.bg/vladimir/crm-graphical/#cidoc_class_hierarchy. Simpler than BFO in its top-level structure, it has these fundamental distinctions:\n** Endurants (continuants) vs Perdurants (occurrents). In CRM, perdurants form a hierarchy: from historic/cultural Periods, to Events (natural or man-made) to Activities (made by a particular Actor).\n** Conceptual (eg the image of Mona Lisa) vs Physical (eg the original painting in the Louvre or a reproduction): a further split of endurants\n** CRM has specific \"part of\" relations for many types: physical object (eg \"page 3 of Abraham Lincoln's copy of the bible\"), conceptual object (eg Sonata part 1 < Sonata), Period/event, Actor (eg person<subgroup<group)\n* In Wikidata too often confusion arises between a design for something and a physical copy made from that design; and which should be an instance. Some have proposed to treat a book (eg Catcher in the Rye) as a subclass of Book, namely the set of all physical copies of Catcher in the Rye. This is totally twisted and won't work.\n* FRBR has dealt with these issues, with the 4 levels Work, Expression (eg a particular translation), Manifestation (eg an edition, something with an ISBN), Item (physical copy); the first 3 are conceptual entities and only the last one is physical. FRBR uses specific relations to cross these levels. I believe that to use the generic relations will cause confusion.\n** Note that I'm not advocating to have all these 4 levels (eg BibFrame has only 3). But we should be aware of the distinctions made by library catalogues, respect them, and generalize the same model for other domains (eg a rocket design vs a physical rocket of that design)\n* Sometimes \"part of\" relations between parts of a design or conceptual entity beget ''parallel'' \"part of\" relations in physical entities. Eg \"pedestals ''conceptual-part-of'' statues\" begets \"pedestal of the Statue of Liberty ''physical-part-of'' Statue of Liberty\". But these need to be considered and \"controlled\" individually and carefully, to avoid confusion.\n\n--[[User:Vladimir Alexiev|Vladimir Alexiev]] ([[User talk:Vladimir Alexiev|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 08:08, 12 January 2015 (UTC)\n{{Discussion bottom}}"

The idea behind the current behavior at Wikidata is to unwind all redirects to get to the correct item, that is the final page pointed to by any previous redirects. This is to verify that we do in fact refer to a single item. The reasoning behind this is to keep things simple, we should only refer to one item on one page. This although creates some structural problems on the Wikipedia-projects where contents about several items can be collected on a single page. There is also nothing in the linked data model itself that says we can not have several items at a single page, we have just chosen to do it like that.\n\nIn a linked web a page with several items can be expressed by having fragment identifiers, and this is also described as one of the main methods to do linkage in a semantic web context. More specifically this is described as a \"Hash URI\" in contrast to what we do, using 303s to redirect to different pages.<ref name=\"hash-uris\">''Cool URIs for the Semantic Web'' [http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/#hashuri]</ref> It is important to note that we do not link to a page with semantic data when we use a sitelink, we point to content page. (''Seems like we have lost the XSD for our sitelinks.'')\n\nIn the usual semantic web it is not necessary to have the hash URI (fragment) point to a specific section, it is left for the user to infer how to use it, but in the Wikidata-context it ''could'' be necessary to verify that the hash URI (fragment) is an actual subsection, but note that this has its own problems. If there is a fragment on the URI it is although a new identifier anyhow and should be treated as such.\n\nThe correct behavior would then be to unwind the URI but to keep any hash (fragment) found during the process and add that back to the URI for the final page. If there are two URIs to the same page, but with different hash (fragment) then the two URIs are different identifiers. For the purpose of identifying the ''internal item'' they are the same, but for identifying an ''external entity'' they are not the same.\n\nTo make an example: <code>Bonnie_and_Clyde#Bonnie</code> is not the same as <code>Bonnie_and_Clyde#Clyde</code> for the purpose of referring to the external entity, but both refer to the common internal concept <code>Bonnie_and_Clyde</code>. Note that in this example there is internal items for {{Q|Q219937}} and for each of the criminals {{Q|Q2319886}} and {{Q|Q3320282}}.\n\nIt should be possible to add a fragment to the URI given for the sitelinks and it should be kept, and it should not be an error to add a fragment that does not exist in the final page, but it could trigger a warning to the user. By not enforcing that a section with the name of the hash (fragment) exist in the document the behavior is more in line with the expected behavior and it also allows use of hash URIs to list-like pages. It will also make the processing more efficient.\n\nAccepting hash URIs will have some consequences. For example the EntityData must strip them off before handling the item, but must keep the fragment during 303 and content negotiation. Other special pages that does redirects should reapply the fragments in the redirect. Lua should be able to use hash URIs for referring to the item, but it should be silently stripped off and the data returned should be the item itself. Later on there could be several items on a page and then the interpretation of the resulting structure is left to the Lua scripts, that is the user.\n\nTwo or more external pages on the same site might be referred to by the same item if all of them uses a hash URI (fragment) less one, but if any two or more use the same fragment (or none) the linkage should be rejected.\n\nA single page can be referred to by two or more sitelinks on different items if they all have different hash URIs (fragment) less one, but if any two or more use the same fragment (or none) the linkage should be rejected.\n\nA single page can not be referred to by more than one sitelink if the only differ in the hash URI (fragment).\n\nThere is a simplified version that is very tempting but has some unfortunate side effects. If the title string of the page holding the redirect is the same as the fragement string, then the unwinding of the redirects can halt and the URI of the page be returned. This will then be the canonical URI used as sitelink.

That has consequences for ''wbgetitems'', but I'm not sure that functionality is in use, and also for ''wblinktitles'' which is more serious as it is used by ''edit links'' (or at least it was supposed to be used by that gadget).

The URI as such when used as an identifier is the complete string with the fragment identifier. URIs that carry information is sometimes described as smart or intelligent identifiers. Much of the linked/semantic data world have split in two groups; one where such smart identifiers are considered bad, and one where they are considered good. Somehow it splits along the lines of linked data (uses URL) and semantic data (uses URN). Both URLs and URNs can be described as URIs, or actually as IRIs but lets not be nitpicking. Identifiers in Wikidata are oblique URIs as seen from the outside, they do not carry any information except being identifiers. Links on Wikipedia do carry information, but you must know how to interpret that information (that is know the language and its grammer). Even if a link do carry additional information, we can very often refuse to use that additional information. We simply let the URI become an oblique identifier for our own internal use. I believe we should handle all links as oblique, even links from Wikipedia, and even fragment identifiers on those links.

On the other hand, since Wikidata does not allow for natural language, a lot of nuance and opportunity for bias goes away.\n\nThis means, that editing Wikidata does not require rules as strict as those for Wikipedia, but still does require rules. The following is a suggestion:\n\n# As per the [[m:Terms of use/FAQ on paid contributions without disclosure|general Wikimedia Terms of Use]], paid editing has to be disclosed - either on the User page of the contributor, or the talk page of the item.\n# Conflict of Interest is broader than paid contribution: e.g. editing the item of your favorite band, about yourself, your friends or rivals, your home town, can all lead to edits with a Conflict of Interest. Such editing in Wikidata is not frowned upon in general, but can indeed be quite helpful: who else but those with a strong interest in a topic would be editing the topic? The following guidelines describe a few behaviors you should be careful about, though.\n# Be careful when / Refrain from creating an item when you have a COI. Be sure to follow the [[Wikidata:Notability|notability]] criteria, and do not try to bend them. When in doubt, don't do it. If you create an item, and someone suggests to delete it, refrain from engaging in the discussion.\n# Do not edit-war over an item when you have a COI. You can make a disclosure on the talk page, add references supporting your point of view, but do not keep editing the same few statements of the topic.\n# Do not delete statements which are unflattering or even untrue, but have a strong reference, on a topic where you have a COI. Remember that Wikidata is about [[Wikidata:Verifiability|verifiability]], not truth - if there is a very strong source for a statement, don't just remove it. Again, you can disclose your COI and suggest the deletion on the talk page, but do not do it yourself.\n# If you are an authority on an item (or a set of item), e.g. acting as their agent, or a company looking for the Wikidata items about their products (movies, cars, songs, etc.), you are allowed and indeed encouraged to keep the data about this item up-to-date and the coverage complete (e.g. box office, awards, cast, official Website, etc.). If you are an authority, you can also use your own website as a reference for the statements that you keep up-to-date or complete.\n# Do not use Wikidata as a venue for original publication or as the primary storage of your data. You should always publish the data under your control in an appropriate venue. This publication can at the same time be used as a source for the statements in Wikidata.\n# Note that labels and descriptions are slightly more sensitive for COI. Try to be as neutral as possible when editing them. Instead of saying \"amazing break-through author of number one thrillers\", write just \"Swedish author\". And if someone changes it to a bland description, do not go and revert it back to your more interesting one.

As a company owner/founder I am an authority on that company, probably the best person to include basic facts about that company. Point 6 allows me to keep the data updated and correct but under (3) not apparently to add that company into WD (based on the fact I'm trying to get that page re-included after deletion) ''Refrain from creating an item when you have a COI'' .  In some respects to this newcomer I also find point 3 the part ''refrain from engaging in the discussion'' if someone suggests a deletion, harsh.

This request however did not attract much interest over the last few months. In the meantime [[User:Jura1]] went ahead and introduced a large number of claims for {{P|735}}. Jura1 went round the language difficulties by creating an entry for every name variant and adjusting the language links accordingly. The link between articles relating to the same meaning is now done through {{P|460}}. As most of the difficulties are already covered in [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/How to deal with given names and surnames]], I just want to give two examples:\n\nThe Slavic name {{Q|18585594}} (or {{Q|10944157}} or {{Q|3627558}}) which is based on George (or Georgios) and is written as \u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 in Russian or \u042e\u0440\u0456\u0439 in Ukrainian.\nHow many wikidata entries should we have 1,3,7 or ?\n\n{{Q|739378}} is also an interesting example. He is currently called {{Q|18130894}}, which indicates that he got this claim from someone looking at the Spanish or Portuguese wikipedia. \n\nThe strict alphabetic approach reduces wikidata to a dictionary. The advantage of linking articles which cover the same subject is lost to a property which just compares sequences of letters.\nI would favour something like maintaining the context by linking only the most common spelling variant of a name in each language through wikidata and do the rest with wikilinks in wikipedia.\n\nMay be there should be two types of given names, a contextual one for names changing with languages and interwikis, and an alphabetic one for (modern) language independent names.

It is smarter to use the relation between the given names themselves. Unlike the alphabetic approach, there are sources to back those relations up, like for example there are book sources for the relation between given names in the nordic countries. The alphabetic approach does not have any such connection. As such, the alphabetic approach is not in line with the explaination of items in the glossary, as the sitelinks are not on an singular subject, and that needs to be dealt with. --[[User:Snaevar|Snaevar]] ([[User talk:Snaevar|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 01:34, 23 December 2015 (UTC)\n:I'm not entirely sure which solution(s) and parts of the glossary you have in mind, but you can't add sources to labels or sitelinks.

New usecases are regularly found for Wikidata, who is not mature enough yet imho to build a strong and precise border, for example see [[mailarchive:wikidata-l/2015-March/005514.html|https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikidata-l/2015-March/005514.html]].

Lots of items get deleted unnecessarily or inappropriately because the only ones likely discussing them other than the proposer (who naturally would be somewhat inclined toward deletion) are users who frequent the RfD page. I don't know that imposing a minimum discussion time is going to accomplish much if it's just going to be the same users participating. On Wikipedia, there is a prominent banner placed directly at the top of the page, bots deliver notifications to the page's creator and significant contributors, etc. I opened a case on [[:WD:IWC]] back in July of last year disputing a merge action, which after seven months has still had zero input, while an item relevant to that case was placed on RfD, and was deleted in three days. I didn't make any edits during that time, but I'm sure I was checking in on the site, including the page for that specific item, and yet I still had no idea that it was up for deletion.

Also, I finally noticed that there is indeed a proposal, focused primarily on the creation of a maintenance category, that addresses most of my concerns. I don't think it would be enough, though. There are some users who never notice that little notifications badge and never read talk pages. On Wikipedia, even among those who do navigate to a talk page, they were often prompted to do so by a banner on the main page. As much of an improvement as it would be to have creators notified and a category for active AfDs, I still would probably not have noticed had that system been in place in my example, despite being an interested party.

Only the latter exists now as the former has been deleted by community decision (see for example [[WD:Requests for comment/Migrating away from GND main type]]).\n\nThere is some open debates in community and controversial discussion about their usage though. One of the issue has been the one of ''can we use both {{instance of}} and {{subclass of}} both on the same item?''. This issue is sometime controversial outside out Wikidata. Some argue this should not be possible because of a philosophical principle, the {{Q|175928}}. Some other because of theorical reasons on the properties of some computer languages in which logical inferences can be made, for performance reasons and/or for all the questions that can be asked to a system that uses this language have an answer. (an example is http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#OWLLite). Other do not have this restriction, such as [[:en:RDF]] or newer versions of [[:en:Web Ontology Language]].\n\nIt is totally possible in Wikidata as Wikidata allows to use any property on any item without restrictions. See for example of useful uses in [[Help:Classification]].\n\nAs the issue has been raised a lot, for example with {{Ping|Denny|Emw|Jobu0101|Micru}} ... I wrote an help page [[Help:Classification]] who is currently a draft. I would want to remove the {{tl|draft}} and so asking community if it is possible to do so.

So with that definition I can't write \"'''anger''' ''is an instance of'' '''feeling'''\". Feelings aren't concrete object or localized objects. So the definition is not good because it can't be generalized.\n: Then the localization in space and time is not relevant for atoms: I can described several energetic levels of a specific atom by several items. So for one atom, I can have several items and this is not in agreement with the proposed definition of \"instance of\".\n: Then the example of the atoms is a good one of closed mind applying a rule without any knowledge about the subject: yes, you can localize an individual atom in time and space, but finally it is something we want to do in Wikidata (ie to create specific items for individual atoms) ? The concept of the proposed classification bypass the most important question: which is the framework of WD ? What is the granularity we want in WD ? This can't be solved by an simple page of 3-5 paragraphs: each domain, each field develops its own limits, so \"instance of\" has to be defined by projects or teams which has a good understanding of the subject. Yes, we can create specific items for individual atoms, but if we don't want to reach that granularity, why can't we use \"instance of\" to the lowest classification level defined/used in WD and not in a hypothetical system ? \n: A better definition of what is an \"instance of\" is the most detailed description an object can have according to the available properties. If we have no possibility in WD to describe the position of an atom at a defined time or no property to be able to distinguish between 2 cars, and we don't want to be able to do that difference, why do we need to apply a so rigorous rule ?\n: To build an ontology we need first to define the framework (what is the purpose of the ontology) and then the granularity (which is the maximal description we want to reach).

These are the tokens in the sense of the token/type relationship. Then angryness is the class of all that events. If we want to classify further, then we want to go higher to higher levels and say that scientists of philosophers considered angryness as some ''cardianal sentiment type'' or whatever they imagined.

There is cases like car models where it is totally possible to have individuals. In that case it is a lot more simple to follow the same principle in both case. A newbie would only have to follow one instruction, otherwise the structure is not robust. Say we decided that some class would not have any instances, and it turns out it has some in Wikidata finally. No luck, we got to modify the model, and that could have implications for every consumers that made some asumptions. With ''Hydrogen'' subclass of ''Atoms'' and ''Hydrogen'' instance of ''chemical element'', it does not matter if someone later create the ''first atom in the world'' article for some reason. This is robust modeling and mathematically robust.

This is a domain specific definition. The only general way is, like I defined, to define that the more detailed object in the specific domain is \"an instance of\" something and then to refer to the specific classification described by the projects to correctly classify the items. And be consistent: with your assumption of possible future change in the model, you have to propose to avoid ANY use of \"instance of\". And with a proper modelling, if you can query all \"subclass of\" or \"instance of\", you can easily modify the classification of a class by bot.

Then with a second use of instance of we can link classes to classes of classes (sets of sets of atom). We can used with well defined stuff twice instance of. And as, contrary to ''subclass of'', instance of is not transitive, a token will nether be a member of a class of classes. This is just elementary maths with a solid definition for what are tokens. As atoms will always be tokens, this is robust. And we can use instance of. <span class=\"mw-code\" style=\"text-align:right; display: inline-block; padding: 0.1em;\">[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] <sup>([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]])</sup> </span> 18:11, 15 April 2015 (UTC)\n::::* I never say that atom was not a potential \"instance of\". The problem is again if this is something we want to model: my proposition is to define as \"instance of\" the lowest level of the classification or the most detailed item of the classification. Then if we decide to model to the individual atom then this becomes the \"instance of\" and if we stay at the level of the element, this becomes the \"instance of\". You are typically what I defined as a closed mind: you have your mathematical reasoning (which is correct) but you completely skip the fact that a mathematical formulation is a tool in the modeling and not the goal.

Which mean that when a newbie will have a problem for classifying anything, we will just have to explain this. And not more something a little bit complicated and area dependant like ''ok, these object exists but we decided in this area that we will model this and not that, but in this case we do that''. And we see a lot those discussion. So I'll totally say I'm in a minimalist philosophical position here :). But a close mind ... no, what's not how I would define myself.

I would be less disturb by subclass of ''sequence of instruction'' for example. It also do not seem right that in the software case we do not do better that in the modeling of book case. FRBR with book/edition/manifestation and so on seems better defined.\n:: Let's begin to think using the class/token relation as first. I think the tokens of a software are many, of different types. For example :\n::* we use the instance word when there is several processus on the same software that run on the same machine. This is a token of execution and it is localized in time and space.\n::* when we buy an edition of a software at the supermarket, or when the coder realeases a new version of their works. There is a realisation as an archive file, who is then duplicated.\n::* not sure I got everything :)\n:: Which of this token are we refering when we speak of the linux kernel ? If we want to class software, it seems reasonable that we have for example to have a ''software type'' class.

I think of this because of a question on project chat about this :\n:: The division token/class/metaclass can solve a problem encountered by the old category system : \n::* Token are administrative divisions like ''ville de Paris''\n::* Classes could be ''commune'' in the case of france, an entity with a mayor and so on\n::* There is other stuffs in the Wikipedia category system that are used to class territorial entities : (I take {{Q|15916867}} ). This is not a class, as a ''french commune'' like Paris is not a ''administrative territorial entity of a single country'', that does not make sense. ''french commune'' instance of ''administrative territorial entity of a single country'' does. This category is used in Wikipedia to class territorial entities, but the category system is not as well defined as the rest. I proposed a correct model, on the administrative territorial entity project, but is seems people flattened the 2-level hierarchy into a simple token/type to do as they did in the Wikipedia category's system. This help page is here to give solid foundation and avoid this kinds of mess. A type like ''french commune'' can very well, and it is useful to sort such cases, an instance of ''type of administrative division'' if we want to respect the subclass of definition : an instance of A if A is a subclass of B is also an instance of B. Which become inconsistent if Paris is a ''administrative territorial entity of a single country'', which does not make sense as, I far as I know, this is the case of every single territorial entity. This would mean that ''administrative territorial entity of a single country'' is equal to ''administrative territorial entitty''. On the other hand if we want to class administrative entity types, we can ahave a metaclass of all ''french territorial entity type'', and everything is consistent again, while retaining links beetween the items. I proposed the following scheme, but we can see that people have deleted the items because they don't understand this and refused metaclasses for bad reasons, and flattened into only one, incorrect hierarchy:\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Administrative division classifications: ''Horizontal'': instance of, ''Vertical'' : Subclass of\n! 1           \n! 2              \n! 3\n|---------------\n|      - \n||     {{Q'|56061}}          \n||     type of administrative division\n\n|---------------\n|      -\n||     {{Q'|192498}}          \n||     class that regroup administrative divisions of a single country\n|----\n| {{Q'|90}} ; {{Q'|12191}}      \n||     {{Q'|484170}}           \n||     class of french administrative division\n\n|} <span class=\"mw-code\" style=\"text-align:right; display: inline-block; padding: 0.1em;\">[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] <sup>([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]])</sup> </span> 12:23, 20 April 2015 (UTC)\n: Problems I see:\n:* Administrative territorial entity in France is not an instance of table of administrative divisions by country.

The english definition is a bit different, it turns out they are different.\n*:::::; The english one (for completeness) : a chemical element is a pure substance (a substance made of only one type of atom, for example a cloud of dihydrogen is an instance of the ''Hydrogen'' class). So in that case, a chemical element is a type of substance.\n*:::::;The one of the french Wikipedia : ''Un \u00e9l\u00e9ment chimique d\u00e9signe l'ensemble des atomes caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s par un nombre d\u00e9fini de protons dans leur noyau atomique.''

But is it a chemical element in the ''subclass of'' sense or in the ''instance of'' sense ? Let's suppose it is in the subclass of. I'll show this is inconsistent with the definition. Let's say {{Subtype|Hydrogen|Chemical element}}. Now say {{Type|the first hydrogen atom in the universe|hydrogen}}. OK, by definition of subclass of (x instance of A and A subclass of B so x instance of B) we get {{type|the first hydrogen atom in the universe|chemical element}}. So by definition of chemical element this would mean ''the first hydrogen atom in the universe is the set all atoms that have the same number of protons'', which is clearly wrong as he is not a set by itself, he is an individual. There is a set of chemical elements, {Hydrogen, Oxygen, ... }, I think we agree. Then by replacing ''Hydrogen'' by the atoms, we can get chemical elements =  {{the first hydrogen atom, ...}, { ... }, ... }. In that sense a metaclass is just a set of set, this is just simple maths. And how can we separate the atoms into those subsets ? By their atomic number of protons.

Help:Classification has an important and admirable goal, but it needs a lot of work and is far from suitable as an official Help page in [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Help:Classification&oldid=210954416 its current form].  I think having separate pages for [[Help:Classification]] and [[Help:Basic membership properties]] could be reasonable, if the many problems in the former were resolved.\n\n: The page's many grammatical errors and stylistic oddities derail attention from the content.  Readers will quickly dismiss documentation with such consistently broken English.  An example of one of the smaller papercuts: use of a space ''before'' punctuation marks.  English never uses a space before colons (e.g. \"Superclasses and subclasses : relationships\") or question marks (\"But what is the relationship, then ?\").  Another papercut: phrases like \"to class classes themselves\" are very unidiomatic -- \"class\" ''can'' be used as a verb in English, but in this context it looks quite odd.  English speakers virtually always use the word \"classify\" instead of using \"class\" as a verb.  Further grammatical and stylistic issues abound.  If an author wants to be taken seriously when writing in English, regardless of their native tongue, they must write well in English.\n\n: More importantly, the content itself is often misfocused and incorrect.  For example, \"The Classification of Wikidatians\u202f ''subclass of'' \u202fThe Wikidatians\" is not only too contrived, it is also wrong.  \"The classification of Wikidatans\" (note conventional spelling, without the extra \"i\") is not in any conventional interpretation of that English phrase a subclass of Wikidatan.  Virtually all English speakers would interpret \"the classification of Wikidatans\" as either A) the activity of classifying Wikidatans or (less commonly) B) the information artifact output by that activity.   Neither of those is a type of Wikidatan.\n\n: We should also avoid using Wikidatans or other in-group references as examples.  \"Wikidatans\" is very much not as familiar a term as \"Wikipedian\", so the term presents an unnecessary road bump in learning.  Even if it were, many of the people reading Help:Classification will not identify as Wikidatans or Wikipedians, making the coverage of this unfamiliar (but important) topic even more foreign.  In short, we need less navel-gazing and more relatable examples; lose the \"Wikidatan\" stuff.\n\n: We should also avoid contrived examples like \"humans who have read this page ''subclass of'' human\".  (I've adapted this from current page's the \"The Wikidatans who read this page\" example.)  Examples like \"city with more than 10,000 inhabitants ''subclass of'' city\", \"chemical element in period 1 ''subclass of'' chemical element\" and \"bird that exists in Europe ''subclass of'' bird\" are technically valid, but inadvisable, because reliable sources overwhelmingly do not build hierarchies along those axes -- the examples are contrived.  Those examples should be modeled using reified properties like ''population'', ''period in periodic table'', and ''inhabited region''.  Help:Classification should probably include some examples it currently uses as anti-patterns. \n\n: Also, we should avoid referring to metaclasses as \"classes of classes\".  That's vague and ambiguous.  A \"class of classes\" could just as well be an ordinary class whose subclasses are classes and none of whose instances are classes.  A metaclass is more precisely \"a class whose instances are classes\".\n\n: Finally, we should avoid including [[:File:Atom_classes.svg]] in the page.  It is overcomplicated, visually quite messy, and as far as I am aware not viewed as a good way to classify chemical entities by anyone but the author.  An image with fewer overlapping lines would be a start.  Get rid of the asterisk lines and use some other distinguishing feature like color.  Put arrowheads on all lines instead of relying on left-right separation of column categories.  Add more padding around the perimeter of the graphic.  Then we can begin to discuss if it a reasonable way to classify elements.

[[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:22, 19 April 2015 (UTC)\n::::::: {{Ping|Emw}}\u00a0It's too early to say that. Queries are not ready yet, and I don't think it is a good idea to put restrictions on these as it could be conflict prone for no real benefit. The Insee uses probably a vast variety of criteria to express datas. I just found an ontology of the datas they uses ( http://rdf.insee.fr/def/geo/insee-geo-onto.ttl ), found [http://rdf.insee.fr/geo/index.html in their rdf page], where we can download rdf datas. I'm noy saying we have to import all this, but I think if we put to much constraint without enough experience as we are not mature enough, this could be a significant pain in the future to introduce more complex concepts like expressing statement on queries or asserting the membership of a class of some item to a query associated to a class. Plus it is really easy to extend a query to include the members of a class. The query could become <code>(X where X.population > 100000 or X instance of ''urban area with more than 100000 inhabitants'')</code>. And we do not know the power of the query engine yet. We will understand what is manageable, what is overkill or what is needed later. <span class=\"mw-code\" style=\"text-align:right; display: inline-block; padding: 0.1em;\">[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] <sup>([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]])</sup> </span> 16:44, 19 April 2015 (UTC)\n:::::::: [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]], I don't think it's too early to tell.  Several Wikidata SPARQL endpoints already exist.  Also, we can safely assume that a future Wikidata query engine will support basic operators like >, <, and =.  \n:::::::: Furthermore, I would point out that the INSEE OWL ontology you linked -- http://rdf.insee.fr/def/geo/insee-geo-onto.ttl -- contains no class for \"urban unit of more than 100,000 inhabitants\" or any other classes for a similar hard-coded threshold number of inhabitants.  The INSEE ontology doesn't seem to include any population data, but it is worth noting that the HTML table on their website is not represented as its own class in their ontology.\n:::::::: The query <code>(X where X.population > 100000 OR X instance of ''urban area with more than 100000 inhabitants'')</code> is clearly suboptimal.  It is redundant.  More concerningly, it also suggests we should have claims like \"Fooville ''instance of'' urban area with more than 100000 inhabitants\" asserted directly in the UI.  [[User:Denny|Denny]] and others have agreed that directly using ''subclass of'' or ''instance of'' several times in a Wikidata item is not a good idea.  Experienced ontologists have written about the pitfalls of such an approach and recommend [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3104413/#S9 asserted monohierarchies and inferred polyhierarchies] as a better strategy for the use of ''instance of'' and ''subclass of''.

I don't think that in Wikidata we can reach the integration on ontology modelling they require in the article. And I don't really understand why you are talking of (explicit) multiple inheritance in our case since we are talking of some ''urban area'' class, and ''urban area with more than 100000 inhabitants'' would only have one parent in this case. Another thing: in our case their could be situations, probably a lot I think, where we will have some classes, but not the information expressed as statements that would be necessary to compute the extension of the class. So I'll continue to be careful and to say that we do not know enough atm to take such decisions ... I think this happens a lot, for example in administrative geography, where cities are not villages or major city, the Flying Spaghetti Monster knows why ... <span class=\"mw-code\" style=\"text-align:right; display: inline-block; padding: 0.1em;\">[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] <sup>([[User talk:TomT0m|talk]])</sup> </span> 18:32, 19 April 2015 (UTC)\n::::::::: {{Ping|Emw}} Also, I think you misread the threads about the query engine.

Lewis|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:59, 14 May 2015 (UTC)}}\n{{RFCSubpage|closed=yes}}\nGoodday!\n\nTwo years ago, a [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/Opting out of Global sysops|RFC]] defined that global sysops having and using their access here is tolerated by the community under certain circumstances. The current policy concerning global sysops reads as follows:\n\n<code>\n[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Global sysops|Global sysops]] and [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Stewards|stewards]] technically have full administrator access (except the ability to assign user rights that can be assigned locally or create properties). However, they are only allowed to use their admin tools for\n\n*blocking accounts and IP addresses in cases of vandalism, spam or long-term abuse\n*performing rollbacks according to {{Ll|Wikidata:Rollbackers|Wikidata's rollback guideline}} and marking edits as patrolled\n*deletions of vandalism or spam\n*non-controversial housekeeping within the MediaWiki namespace\n\nThey must not revert or overrule any actions that are performed by a local administrator. If a global sysop misuses their rights, any local user in good standing may ask them to stop.\n</code>\n\nI still believe our community is big enough to entrust users with such tasks on their own. Especially the recent [[Wikidata:Requests for permissions/Administrator/Aldnonymous|failed RFA attempt]] of a global sysop raises the question, if our community wants to give away the decision about who holds advanced rights on this wiki that easily, the global sysop in question yet technically has full admin access to this wiki, even though they do not fulfil the local criteria for obtaining adminship, as of today.<ref>This is explicitly just an example, not criticism on that user's work as a global sysop.</ref> This could be continued to the point when a possible GS in the admin/global sysop double-role on this wiki is removed due to a community decision here due to abuse (similar case: TBloemink) and their flag would yet stay irremovable from our point of view.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the GS who have made use of their access to this wiki in the past have not respected our policy at all either, as can be seen in the following analysis ''of current global sysops only'':\n\n* [[Special:Log/Alan|Alan]]: 5 actions within scope, 2 actions out of scope\n* [[Special:Log/Aldnonymous|Aldnonymous]]: 2 actions within scope\n* [[Special:Log/BRUTE|BRUTE]]: did not make use of the extra access\n* [[Special:Log/Defender|Defender]]: 1 action out of scope\n* [[Special:Log/\u00c9rico|\u00c9rico]]: 2 actions within scope\n* [[Special:Log/Glaisher|Glaisher]]: 39 actions within scope\n* [[Special:Log/Jafeluv|Jafeluv]]: did not make use of the extra access\n* [[Special:Log/Kaganer|Kaganer]]: 13 actions out of scope\n* [[Special:Log/Liliana-60|Liliana-60]]: 11 actions out of scope, 2 of them immediately reverted by a local admin\n* [[Special:Log/Mh7kJ|Mh7kJ]]: did not make use of the extra access\n* [[Special:Log/MoiraMoira|MoiraMoira]]: 5 actions within scope\n* [[Special:Log/NahidSultan|NahidSultan]]: did not make use of the extra access\n* [[Special:Log/PiRSquared17|PiRSquared17]]: 1 action within scope, 4 actions out of scope\n* [[Special:Log/Tiptoety|Tiptoety]]: 4 actions within scope\n* [[Special:Log/Toto Az\u00e9ro|Toto Az\u00e9ro]]: did not make use of the extra access\n* [[Special:Log/Vogone|Vogone]]: local admin\n* [[Special:Log/Wim b|Wim b]]: did not make use of the extra access\n\nThis makes in total 58 global sysop actions within scope and 30 actions out of scope resp. 5 current global sysops who had all their actions within scope vs. 5 current global sysops who technically abused their access.\n\nThe little need of GS assistance on this wiki combined with the issues raised above make me believe a GS opt-out should be considered. --[[User:Vogone|Vogone]] ([[User talk:Vogone|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:18, 22 April 2015 (UTC)\n\n\n<references />\n\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Opting out ==\n\n=== Yes ===\n\n# --[[User:Vogone|Vogone]] ([[User talk:Vogone|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:22, 22 April 2015 (UTC)\n#With around 90 sysops, not a lot left for them to do after we started redirecting instead of deleting items, and with several questionable actions from global sysops and stewards lately, I think it's time. --'''[[User:Rschen7754|Rs]][[User talk:Rschen7754|chen]][[Special:Contributions/Rschen7754|7754]]''' 01:10, 23 April 2015 (UTC)\n#:We're not nearly 90 now \u2014 though I agree there's less work than before. --<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">[[User:Ricordisamoa|<span style=\"color:#004B70\">Ricordi</span>]][[User talk:Ricordisamoa|<span style=\"color:#00703E\">samoa</span>]]</span> 03:19, 3 May 2015 (UTC)\n# [[User:Matiia|Matiia]] ([[User talk:Matiia|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 01:16, 23 April 2015 (UTC)\n#It does not make much sense anymore.

The urgent need of a new notability policy is missing in the statement by [[User:GZWDer|GZWDer]]:\n:* The guideline is indeed quite vague in points of what \"serious and publicly available references\" are. In theory, every person which was mentioned in any local newpaper is notable on Wikidata, as the newspaper is serious for sure and also publicly available. This issue also came up on RFD several times when items were listed for deletion which described some (on Wikipedia irrelevant) companies. However, as they were mentioned on some journals etc. there exist \"serious and publicly available references\" so the notability guideline was in favour of them.\n:* Criteria 3 already works quite well at the moment, However, there are also a lot of people or other things out there which might be somehow connected to a notable item. Basically, the whole humanity is if we use father/mother/children properties. Therefore, we also need some limit for criteria 3.\n: Best regards, -- [[User:Bene*|Bene*]] [[User talk:Bene*|<sup>t</sup><sub>a</sub><sup>l</sup><sub>k</sub>]] 09:51, 9 May 2015 (UTC)\n\n== Discussion ==\n\n=== #1 ===\n*What's the reason to exclude items with only a sitelink to a category page in Wikimedia Commons? --[[User:Pasleim|Pasleim]] ([[User talk:Pasleim|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:50, 24 May 2015 (UTC)\n**This should be clearified.

Examples:\n:# A book has an author, a publisher, and a printer. (Assume the book is notable.) Perhaps there may be a Wikisource Author page or even Wikipedia page made for the author in the future, but this is very likely not true of the publisher and printer. Does that mean we should lose that data?\n:# There are subjects of books that don't have WP pages. Some may read this as \"there may be a Wikimedia article in the future\" but others may not. See the next example.\n:# Recently I've been transcribing entries in a 1920 biographical encyclopedia and trying to get the basic information onto Wikidata. This includes educational institutions that are now defunct and may have only existed for a relatively short period of time (<50y).

The main problem I have with the existing criteria 3 is that it doesn't actually clarify what counts as a structural need, so I like that you've tried to address that. I would suggest combining both into something along the lines of:\n:* It fulfills a '''structural need''':\n:** The item is useful for linking two items meeting #1 or #2 (and probably #3) which are not directly linked (for example {{Q|19302079}}).\n:** The item is directly linked from an item meeting #1 or #2 (and probably #3 and/or #4).\n: - [[User:Nikki|Nikki]] ([[User talk:Nikki|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:46, 9 May 2015 (UTC)\n*I agree that criterion 2 needs tightening. A \"clearly identifiable conceptual or material entity\" can apply to virtually anything. I would suggest changing it to something akin to \"is discussed by at least one reliable, independent source\". Criterion 1 is good as it is, in my opinion. Criterion 3 could be clarified slightly; perhaps something allowing a) items that are linked to from another item and b) items that complete a set of mostly notable items. --'''[[User:Jakec|Jakob]] ([[user talk:Jakec|talk]])''' 20:22, 9 May 2015 (UTC)\n**{{ping|Jakec}} This is part of why we badly need a verifiability policy, because at this time \"reliable, independent source\" is for the purposes of Wikidata ill-defined.--[[User:Jasper Deng|Jasper Deng]] ([[User talk:Jasper Deng|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:46, 24 May 2015 (UTC)\n* Current #3 criterion covers much more cases than suggested #3-5 criteria.

I see the existing three criteria as establishing different levels of notability. Criterion 1 establishes what I call \"''project'' notability\", criterion 2 establishes \"''independent'' notability\", and criterion 3 establishes \"''dependent'' notability\". In my view, anything that is independently notable by meeting criterion 2 should be included, as should anything meeting the standards of project notability. However, ''dependently'' notable topics should only be included if their inclusion benefits either items with independent or project notability or Wikidata as a whole. While I generally prefer fixed rules over judgement calls, I do believe that this judgement is best made on a case-by-case basis. I don't necessarily prefer one version of criterion 2 over the other, but I believe that common sense should dictate the interpretation of criterion 3, rather than a list of rules. -[[User:Happy5214|happy]][[User talk:Happy5214|5214]] 06:23, 7 October 2015 (UTC)\n\n==Human degrees of separation for notability==\n(Also posted to chat) It seems we have agreed that we can create entries for the spouse, parents, siblings, and children of notable people.

It seems to mean to migrate almost all properties of datatype string, listed at [[Special:ListProperties/string]].\n\n'''Concern''':\n* There are already problems with the distinction between monolingualtext and string, see [[Wikidata:Properties for deletion]] P1782, P1785.

Datatype\n! Description\n! Type [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase/DataModel/JSON]\n|-\n| Commons media \n| '''Link to''' files stored at Wikimedia Commons.

Defaults to \"Earth\" and then \"WGS84\". It adds a resolution and range.\n| globecoordinate\n|-\n| Quantity\n| '''Literal data''' field for a quantity that relates to some kind of well-defined unit. The actual unit goes in the data values that is entered.\n| string\n|-\n| String\n| '''Literal data''' field for a string of glyphs. Typical use are identifiers that have written forms which do not depend on the language of the reader.\n| string\n|-\n| Time\n| '''Literal data''' field for a time value. Given as a time with some precision and boundaries. The time is always saved internally in the Proleptic Gregorian format, but can use other formats during parsing and formatting.\n| time\n|-\n| URL\n| '''Literal data''' field for a URL. URLs are restricted to the protocols also supported for external links in wikitext.\n| string\n|-\n| Item\n| '''Link to''' other items at the project. When a value is entered, the project's \"Item\" namespace will be searched for matching items.\n| wikibase-entityid\n|-\n| Property\n| '''Link to''' properties at the project. When a value is entered, the project's \"Property\" namespace will be searched for matching properties.\n| wikibase-entityid\n|-\n| Monolingual text\n| '''Literal data''' field for a string that is not translated into other languages. This type of string is defined once and reused across all languages. Typical use is a geographical names written in the local language, an identifier of some kind, a chemical formula or a Latin scientific name.\n| string\n|}\n\nAdditionally there are properties that are of an undeclared type:\n* sitelink (string/Wikimedia identifier)\n* alias (~monolingual text)\n* label (~monolingual text)\n* description (~monolingual text)\n\nConceptually close are:\n* Literals:\n** '''Literal data''': string [sometimes, e.g. {{P|373}} behave similar to sitelink], monolingual text, label, alias, URL (close to links)\n** not listed at [[Special:ListDatatypes]]: label, alias, description\n** subgroup: Time, Quantity, globe-coordinate\n* Links:\n** '''Link to''': Item, commons media, property\n** not listed at [[Special:ListDatatypes]]: sitelink\n\n[[User:FreightXPress|FreightXPress]] ([[User talk:FreightXPress|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 00:33, 10 May 2015 (UTC)\n\n== Comments ==\n* I actually don't understand why this is a request for comment. What should we comment on? You are mainly listing things which are already clear. The technical requirements and needs for such a datatype are described in detail in the bug. The problem which arised concerning the monolingual text datatype have nothing to do with the new datatype. Introducing this new identifier datatype does not necessarily mean that the string datatype will be removed. Therefore, I really don't get the point why this requires an RFC. In my opinion RFCs should be used only for controversial things or changes to guidelines. This however rather belongs into a WikiProject or something like that.

I do not expect Commons to create catogories for all of them. Instead there is a category for [[Commons:Category:Junsele|the main populated place and namesake of all these entities]]. Wikimedia Commons is about files, not about much more. Almost any file that can be used to illustrate the civil parish, can be used to illustrate the district, the municipality or the parish. And since I do not expect that it ever will be possible to connect one page in Commons, with more than one item here, I think P373 have to stay as a solution.  -- [[User:Innocent bystander|Innocent bystander]] ([[User talk:Innocent bystander|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 07:15, 25 June 2015 (UTC)\n:@[[User:Innocent bystander|Innocent bystander]] : that doesn't at all the question. \u00ab Wikimedia Commons is about files, not about much more. \u00bb If it was really true there wouldn't be this big how-to-link-to-Commons problem. Beside files, Commons has a lot of categories and some galleries (30 times less). The question is \u00ab when there is no gallery, can we put the category instead ? \u00bb If we refer to [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/Commons links]], it's a compromise between point I and point II : \u00ab Articles with galleries if exist, if else article with categories. \u00bb PS: your exemple is too specific and not representative of how Commons or Wikipedias are structured.\n:Personnaly, I think there is something wrong with the whole model, not only the categories but how all the namespaces are not dealt by wikidata.\n:Cdlt, [[User:VIGNERON|VIGNERON]] ([[User talk:VIGNERON|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:00, 26 June 2015 (UTC)\n::{{ping|VIGNERON}} On Wikipedia and Wikidata, we are very specific to describe if something is located ''on'' the island of Iceland or ''in'' the country of Iceland. If a picture of a house is located ''in'' the country or ''on'' the island, is not a big deal for the users at Commons. It's possible that there are two categories for Iceland in this specific case, but normally there isn't. My example describes the extreme situation in Sweden, who has a long range of administrative entities, with almost the same size and boundaries. But they have very different administrative purpose and history. Therefor, we have specific WP-articles about each of them. But it is not the purpose of Commons to describe such things, the hierarchy of categories are therefor much more simple than the article-set on Wikipedia. The exception is the \"categories by year\"-tree, that is much more specific on Commons than on Wikipedia. (Another big difference is that on Commons, Wikimedia-users can be regarded as Authors. If the file-namespace would have been included here, it should have be necessary to include the user-namespace here at Wikidata.)\n::To make it possible to handle these big differences between Commons and Wikipedia, I think it is necessary to keep P373, to solve the interwiki-asymmetry.\n::If we should match ns:0@Commons with ns:0@Wikipedia is another question. I do not have a simple answer here. Interwiki ''can'' be solved by the help of {{P|910}} and {{P|301}} when we have Arbitrary Access on Commons and all of Wikipedias, but I think that would be counterintuitive for the users at Commons and Wikipedia. We are used to regard ns:Category as the main namespace on Commons (when file-namespace is excluded). If we insist to match ns:0@Commons with ns:0@Wikipedia, we have to be prepared to fight an eternal war against the intuition of the users on WP and Commons. How many among us are prepared to fight that eternal war? We can set up a policy on Commons, on every Wikipedia and here. But as long as we accepts new users and we have a counterintuitive policy, there will be complaints and unrest. \n::I do not know how many of the newbies, who even know about the Gallery-namespace on Commons. And to be honest, I do not know if many users on Wikipedia care about it at all. I have never seen any link to it on WP, and users on Wikipedia still make local Galleries on Wikipedia with their own preferred set of files. I therefor think that the matching of ns:0@Wikipedia with ns:category@Commons should be the first choise even when there exists a Gallery. How the Gallery-namespace should be linked here, is also a headach. I do not have an answer to that today. -- [[User:Innocent bystander|Innocent bystander]] ([[User talk:Innocent bystander|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 06:31, 27 June 2015 (UTC)\n::: Galleries?

Before anything else, Wikidata should have a '''W:''' namespace and accept some degree of specialisation of its database towards the Wikimedia projects. The current universalist approach leads to absurd contradictions such as all the \u201c{{P|P31}} : {{Q|Q4167836}}\u201d elements, which are things we certainly don't want in the main space of a universalist database. They are an aberration to begin with. Second, the 1:1-link principle should be dropped ; this would have been a mess without Wikidata but centralization made it possible to have more relevant systems. Of course we want to link [[c:Category:November 2015 Paris attacks]] to both [[w:en:November 2015 Paris attacks]] and [[w:en:Category:November 2015 Paris attacks]], and both [[c:Pablo Picasso]] and [[c:Category:Pab~lo Picasso]] to [[w:en:Pablo Picasso]]. There are also plenty of cases where one Wikipedia article corresponds to several Wikidata items, that's the redirection issue. The 1:1-link principle is terrible, absolutely inappropriate.

Apparently the feature doesn't work yet on multi-lingual wikis. After that they'd still have to develop the templates, and presumably a bot to fix all those cross-namespace links that now exist. In the meantime, it seems pointless for people to revert site links from Commons categories to article-type Wikidata items manually. Perhaps this could be an outcome for this RFC: tolerate the cross-namespace links until Wikidata support on Commons is fully implemented.

Some thoughts:\n:*I do not think we need to \"allow Wikidata to have multiple links to the same wiki\" as we can use properties to have the same effect. \n:*I think we should encourage people and bots to be adding and maintaining properties to Commons pages, like \n::*[[Property:P373]] to Commons categories\n::*[[Property:P935]] to Commons galleries\n::*[[Property:P1472]] to Commons [[c:template:Creator|Creator]] pages\n::*[[Property:P1612]] to Commons [[c:template:Institution|Institution]] pages\n:*Also links to other Wikidata pages are essential\n::*[[Property:P910]] to Wikidata category page\n::*[[Property:P301]] to Wikidata article page\n:*Site links to Commons, in my opinion, should not cross namespace lines. However they become less relevant as they become less deterministic. \n:*I assume that once [[Wikidata:Arbitrary_access|arbitrary access]] is activated we will write templates or gadgets for Commons categories which will be able to look up wikidata and automatically add interwiki links to wikipedia articles and to wikipedia categories, if present. I imagine something like [[:en:Beta Features/Other projects sidebar|Other projects sidebar]] on Wikipedia. This will be a great improvement over current situation where you do not know if clicking interwiki link in the category page will lead you to wikipedia article of category. \n:*I think we could use greater integration of wikidata article and category pages. They should share properties so I can access date of birth of someone the same way from article and from category namespace. Otherwise we are running a risk that some will start adding properties to Category pages on Wikidata and those will have to be kept in synch with the same properties on the article page.

In my mind, generalizing the way sitelinks work, so they fulfill Mediawiki crosswiki needs (e.g. by having the ability to reference categories, articles, galleries, Wiki travel guides, etc.) is preferable to building a fairly complex and hard to maintain \"network\" of relationships using explicit items and properties. Of course, we would need the buying and support of the dev team to support such a scheme. (How are sitelinks maintained in the data model? Are they even part of it or \"hardcoded\" in some way for each item?) --[[User:Srittau|Srittau]] ([[User talk:Srittau|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:12, 31 December 2015 (UTC)\n:::I like the \"ontology of the world\" idea as it seems closer to my idea of single set of properties (instead of the same properties for category and article items.

That will make Wikidata have some use on Commons (other than interwiki links for templates, which seems to me the main use so far), and hopefully will encourage developments of tools that rely on Wikidata. With those tools the problem might resolve itself if someone comes out with a way to add interwiki links in some way acceptable to Commons through Java scripts or templates. May be by modifying [[Q22015154|MediaWiki:InterProject.js]] and embedding Q-code to the article-wikidata page in some template.

I regularly work at the intersection between Wikidata, Commons and Wikipedia, adding commons categories to Wikipedia articles, uploading photos to Commons (and often creating new categories for them), and populating Wikipedia infoboxes with Wikidata values. I particularly find the interwiki links between Commons categories and Wikipedia articles through Wikidata very valuable, and very timesaving. I mostly find Commons gallery pages to be a waste of time, as they frequently haven't been edited this decade, but I gather some people find them useful.\n* So I really like the idea of being able to link to both galleries and categories using the 'other sites' option (or, better, a dedicated Commons option), because:\n** It avoids the whole debate about whether it's best to link to galleries or categories, and it would mean that interwikis are available from both on Commons.\n** It would put an end to the 'commons category' property that links to the categories, often in duplication to the 'other sites' links, but doesn't carry over the interwiki links. (Although, this is useful for linking to Commons categories in infoboxes, so this might need a better way to access the other site links in Wikipedia articles).\n* Options that wouldn't work include:\n** The status quo. You risk edit wars about whether categories or galleries are the better ones to link to from 'Other sites', and you keep the unnecessary duplication of information.\n** Saying 'no cross-namespace linking'. There are frequently only commons categories corresponding to Wikipedia articles (e.g., individual buildings/structures) without commons galleries (and a systematic creation of such galleries is unlikely to happen, and probably not desirable), so this approach is shooting the projects in the foot.\n** Counting on 'arbitrary access' to fix everything. It won't help with interwikis, and it's more complex to handle, making it more difficult to implement in practice - it's better to have a simpler solution if possible.\n* In the long run, merging Commons and Wikidata might be the best ultimate solution, with Commons categories and pages replaced by Wikidata items and rankings respectively, but that's probably still a number of years of development work away. ;-) Thanks.

If we simply allow both galleries and categories to be linked would be an easy fix but we should also allow linking to the Creator and Institution namespaces [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Namespaces here] that commons uses as well.

I found some colors missing the {{p|279}} claims, but saw that various editors remove such claims in favour of {{p|31}} = {{q|1075}} claims.\n\nI therefore would like to invite comments for the following questions. I also invite edits to my questions if you object with their neutrality.\n\n== Comments ==\n\n* I don't think that one can answer this question without first determining what color is supposed to be.  There are quite a few different potential meanings for color, including particular RGB values, particular print colors, particular wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, and descriptive colors.   In all but the last, it appears to me that colors are true individuals and instances of {{q|1075}} - each color is a particular value and there are no generalization relationships between them.  In the last, however, it appears to me that colors are best described as classes, as there are many generalization relationships between the colors - crimson is a specialization of red, for example.   Some colors, perhaps the named color of some trademarked object, in this particular account might somehow be different from other colors in that they have no class-like behavior.  Whether this means that colors are instances or subclasses of {{q|1075}} then depends on what {{q|1075}} is supposed to be.  If {{q|1075}} is the universal color then colors are probably subclasses of it.  If {{q|1075}} is the class of human-notable colors then human-notable colors are instances of it.  If {{q|1075}} is a vague class somehow related to colors then maybe some colors are instances of it, others are subclasses of it, and yet others are both.  The description of {{q|1075}}, \"visual perception of light wavelengths\", appears to rule out the first sort of interpretation. [[User:Peter F. Patel-Schneider|Peter F.

When we see light of that king, we say (actually we don't, but that's what happens)  \"oh, I see red light coming from that object\" (we say \"that object is red). So red is a class of light : {{SubType|Red light|light}}. Then colors are specific classes of lights, characterized for example by a range of wavelenth. So we can pretty well say {{Type|red|color}} (taking \"red\" as a synonym of \"red light\")\u00a0just as we say Porshe 911 is a car model, I saw a Porshe 911 in the street yesterday.

However, when you speak of blue as a group of colors as opposed to a specific color (such as royal blue is still \"a shade of blue\" versus \"royal blue\" is darker than \"blue\"), that takes on a different meaning. I'd probably lean to how [[Q953243]] has it now: royal blue is an instance of color (Color(0, 35, 102)), but a subclass of <small>the group of colors generally referred to as</small> blue. <span style=\"background:#008;border:2px solid #000;font-variant:small-caps\">&nbsp;[[User:Hazard-SJ|<b style=\"color:#FFF\">Hazard</b>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Hazard-SJ|<b style=\"color:#FFF\">SJ</b>]]&nbsp;</span> 22:28, 23 December 2015 (UTC)\n:: But there is a contradiction in [[Q953243]], [[User:Hazard-SJ|Hazard-SJ]]:\n::* {{Q|953243}} {{P|31}} {{Q|1075}}\n::* {{Q|953243}} {{P|279}} {{Q|1088}}\n::* {{Q|1088}} {{P|31}} {{Q|1075}}\n::: Currently an item that has a sRGB color hex triplet of 002366 is the instance of a color that has the sRGB color hex triplet of 0000FF.

Royal blue really wouldn't be a subclass, unless we have different types of royal blue. Blue itself, though, is an instance of color (considering blue to be Color(0, 0, 255)), but also a subclass if you consider blue as a group of colors ([[Q2749750|tints and shades]] included). In a sense, this shifts the above from royal blue to blue, but what I think is that \"blue, the color\" (Color(0, 0, 255)) is different from \"blue, the group of colors\" (sky blue, royal blue, navy blue, etc.). Is the sky the color blue, or is the sky a tint/shade of blue? Our entity for blue seems to merge the two concepts in one, so strictly speaking, our blue entity is both an instance and a subclass (strange, but that's at least what I'm thinking at the moment). <span style=\"background:#008;border:2px solid #000;font-variant:small-caps\">&nbsp;[[User:Hazard-SJ|<b style=\"color:#FFF\">Hazard</b>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Hazard-SJ|<b style=\"color:#FFF\">SJ</b>]]&nbsp;</span> 04:48, 4 January 2016 (UTC)\n\n== Question: p31, p279, both ==\nShould colors be classified treating them as instances ({{p|31}}), as subclasses ({{p|279}}), or are there reasons to use both properties?

In the case of things we typically think of as \"fixed objects in space and time\" -- a.k.a. {{Q|223557}} -- one should indeed not use {{P|31}} unless the subject has a unique or same spatial location for every point in time.  \n\nRegarding the ambiguity that [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] asserts can exist -- \"any given object having a continuing existence can also be thought of as multiple instances of the 'object at a given time'\" -- I do not recall ever seeing that assertion made in any actual ontologies or philosophical literature.  Widely-used top-level ontologies like BFO (https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO) have considered properties like {{P|585}} (which they label \"at time\"), but do not consider each usage of that property to comprise a distinct individual.  There is no ambiguity; noone actually believes that an instance of a physical object existing at multiple points in time entails it is multiple instances.\n\nFinally, please do not base proposals on syntactically [http://english.stackexchange.com/q/9746 negative questions] (\"does that not dillute\").  The logically correct answer is often the opposite of what speakers respond. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 01:36, 4 January 2016 (UTC)\n\n: I think I mostly agree with what [[User:Emw|Emw]] says above - if I understand it. On the ambiguity issue though, I was maybe thinking of the case of {{Q|252688}} vs {{Q|42369}} - which is an event repeating in time rather than a physical object; however I'm not certain there are hard-and-fast boundaries one can draw that prevent leaking of that sort of time-based instance-of/class relationship into actual physical objects - for example why treat an event that way but not the venue in which it is held - buildings change over time too. As does anything that's not an elementary particle. The issue here is what does \"instance\" mean. We seem to be relying on an intuition that is not at all clear to me at least.

The Type-Token distinction is one philosophical stance, but the wikipedia page you link to hardly does it justice (and I'm surprised there's no French version?) See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/types-tokens/ this Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry] for a much more nuanced view of the matter. Most of discourse concerns what seem by those arguments to be types, not tokens (I think the only \"tokens\" in our discussion here are the references to ourselves as individual people) so the distinction may not even be helpful in most situations - if almost everything is a type, why does the type/token distinction matter? It becomes even more confusing now with electronic devices: words written on a web page are \"types\", locally stored on the web server(s?) as tokens, which get copied to a different spatial location with each download (if the page is ever downloaded). There is presumably one token consisting of the rendering as presented by the browser on the screen at any given occasion of viewing the page, but there's another token corresponding to the local storage by the browser of a cached copy of the page, etc. etc. And all that seems pretty irrelevant to wikidata's needs. What are the real practical questions we are trying to address here? Here's a list of the questions I think that matter:\n:::* what does \"instance of\" mean within wikidata?\n:::* what does \"subclass of\" mean?\n:::* do we need to distinguish classes and metaclasses, and allow for several levels of metaclasses?\n:::* does a given item in wikidata (i.e. some particular Qxxxx) always correspond to a single logical/philosophical semantic construct, or can it represent several different things at once (as ordinary language often does)?\n::: On the first question (and also addressing some of the others), I think this paper by Doug Foxvog on how Cyc handled it is instructive: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231599269_Instances_of_Instances_Modeled_via_Higher-Order_Classes \"Instances of Instances Modeled via Higher-Order Classes\"]. It describes their use of some clear metaclass levels with \"fixed order\", i.e. every metaclass of that type had instances that were of the metaclass below. But they also needed variable-order metaclasses. Not everything fits into the neat fixed-order metaclass structure that a philosopher might like.\n::: On the last question, I have really enjoyed Douglas Hofstadter's writings on level-crossings and the complexities of representation; I just recently finished reading his book with Emmanuel Sander, \"Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire of Thinking\". The book was apparently written in French and English simultaneously -I'd encourage you to locate a copy. To me they seem to strongly advocate for quite a different philosophical stance than the token-type distinction: more important to both our everyday thinking and to creativity is generation of categories through analogy, a spontaneous and constantly evolving process that starts from an individual instance of some concept presented to us, and grows over time as we are each exposed to more examples that appear similar in some fashion. To that extent, the category is, initially at least, represented specifically by the archetypal instance. Albert Einstein, for example, is both clearly an individual person who did specific things in his life, but also a representative of a type of genius (and likely other types, such as hair style) and one can talk of an \"Einstein\" of (as Google autocomplete suggests): \"money\", \"India\", \"the 21st century\", etc. Should wikidata contain an entry both for Einstein as a person and also for Einstein as a type? Maybe, but this is such a ubiquitous phenomenon that I believe this is both impractical and contrary to the way human understanding actually works. We need to live with at least some ambiguity to make our tools (like wikidata) as useful as things like language, which have these ambiguities built in. At least that's my feeling on this right now - I'm willing to be convinced otherwise of course but I think it needs some very clear thinking and not just relying on particular philosophical principles that are not universally held. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:26, 11 April 2016 (UTC)\n:::: {{Ping|ArthurPSmith}} To your question \"can Albert Einstein be a type\", I think we already have everything we need. The answer is something similar to type specimens for taxons and minerals, that used to be the proof that a taxon could be instantiated. Let the class of all \"Albert Einstein\" genius be the class of all person that exhibits Einstein-like behavior (that qualifies the reasons for which we consider a genius). Then Einstein will be our \"type specimen\" that prove that this class make sense. This is not really a difficulty for the class/token distinction, nor to the definition by extension of such a class : we define the class by similarity of an individual. Indeed the Cyc paper is interesting, integrated into [[:en:metaclass (Semantic Web)]] almost as I read it, but it's not really new material for my personal reflection. The levels allows us to consider classes as if they were tokens, so it's not really a problem that a lot of stuffs are classes : they are instances of something, and on a materialistic perspective they probably have tokens. So we can do exactly the same by considering them as instance of some metaclass that by considering them tokens instance of a class. Except we force us to answer the question \"what are the tokens at sake here\". No big deal, we just gain in ontological clarity and into foundation of our ontology. Indeed this should be consolidated, I'm tired of repeating (almost) the same things over and over. I wrote [[Help:Classification]]\u00a0for this, there is all those ontology wikiproject and classification noticeboard, not of much use we must admit at that point.

It seems to me we do agree on (at a common-sense level) what \"instance of\" means - the Cyc paper shows pretty clearly what can happen. I think I'd like to work out some concrete examples (like \"taxon rank\" or the third-order color classification or maybe some of the things related to chemistry or manufactured objects) that clearly demonstrate what we're looking for. The Stanford encyclopedia article suggested that the meaning of \"instance of\" is actually rather domain-specific. Is there a good place in [[Wikidata:WikiProject_Ontology]] to work on these things?

I am starting to feel like that is a bad idea. A calculated value does not always have the same precision as one that can be found in a source and we do not always know what value is the derived value and which is the measured fact. \n\nOne example: The source {{Q|20087097}} tells me that {{Q|2791237}} in 1990 had a population of 68 in an area of 5 {{Q|35852}} and a population-density of 1,278 km<sup>-2</sup>. A calculation would give 1360 km<sup>-2</sup>, but that is not what the source tells us. The difference here probably comes from the fact that the area is closer to 5.3 ha than 5.0 ha. \n\nSecond example: When there is a large {{Q|175331}}, we are often told the number of participants by the police. That number is normally not based on a head count. It is based on estimates of the density of the crowd multiplied with the area covered. Here the \"population\" is a derived number, while the \"density\" is a basic fact. \n\nI can give you a number of properties in astronomy that also ''can'' be derived, but I prefer to not calculate them, since I think we loose information from the source when we do that. The minor planet Sedna have never been observed near its Apoapsis. That number is therefor based on calculations. That can be seen in the sources, since that number has a very poor precision. If we do not allow us to add such properties into our items, I think we loose information.\n\n\n== Discussions ==\nI am not saying that we ''have to'' add a property about population density and other derived properties to every item we have.

I'd also say there is no special problem if it's clearly stated that it's a computation and the method is stated. The key issue would be how to model the sources of the raw datas in the statement, as there may be several sources in Wikidata with different numbers, hypothetically, and it may be ambiguous for a computation if we don't know which one to use. An alternative would be to just leave it unsourced. But as the dev team noticed in a thread on the subject, we can't anyway count on any kind of inferences done directly in Wikibase anytime soon, so any kind of inference or computation for other statement would actually be done by bot creating a statement, or in infoboxes or clients ...

In physics we have both {{P|2114}} and {{P|2645}} which are related by a simple scale factor (ln(2)). However one is traditionally used for one type of system (nuclides) and the other used for others (elementary particles), so having both is helpful to enter exactly what source materials use and to provide what people are accustomed to. However, it seems to me it would be helpful to have some way to query/obtain one property value from the other if it has not been stated explicitly. Maybe that has to be done by external tools rather than anything internal to wikidata; I certainly don't see an obvious mechanism for this within wikidata's structure at the moment.

These issues should be resolved through discussion, where there is no place for threads to remove bot flags. In our bot, we do have checks in place which rely on either WDQ or WDQS. These are mainly to check across Wikidata items for similar/identical claims. These checks sometimes do fail, because of some update issue with the WDQ/WDQS.  I assume these are not the check being discussed here, but is this a correct assumption? Another example of an issue that might get punished is where according to one resource, a claim is deprecated and other resources annotate it as either normal or even preferred.

To accelerate the replacement of value without reference or with unreliable reference (typically data imported from Wikipedia based on the rule that WP is not a source) can we agree on the deletion of existing values without reference or using {{p|143}} for sourcing their Wikipedia origins '''if and only if''' the new value has an external reference ?\n\n# {{support}}/{{oppose}} Comment\n# {{weak support}} The bot should only delete the statement with {{p|143}} if it doesn't give more information than the sourced one or if the information in the Wikipedia field is incorrect based on the source. There are for example some biographies in Wikidata in which the {{p|143}} is the full day while the correctly sourced one is only the year. Deleting the {{p|143}} by a rule in this case will make us lose information, so it is not the desired behavior. In this example it could be acceptable deleting the information if the data in the source is supposed to be true (we also can import deprecated data). Following the last example this could be applied if the sourced year is different than the non-sourced full date's year. -- [[User:Agabi10|Agabi10]] ([[User talk:Agabi10|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:57, 20 November 2015 (UTC)\n# {{support}} This seems sensible - Agaib10's qualifier regarding \"more information\" seems appropriate too; I would even more strongly support this in the case of replacing claims with no source reference at all. However, I would hope that for each bot task the reviewers will look and ensure that the external reference being relied on is MORE reliable than wikipedias; this isn't a good rule if we're allowing any external site to replace consensus data which does have some value. In that vein, perhaps we need an additional rule that every specific external source that has data being pulled in by a bot should have its own designated bot task with approval process required.

I was a wikipedia author for many years and I would say that the references used in de:WP are reliable.

The problem is, I guess, that so far infoboxes can\u00b4t decide which data + references to choose. But why couldn\u00b4t the infobox (the module) say, if there are two datas + references, choose the one that is not imported from wikipedia?

We are no necessarily doubting about the reliability of the data imported from Wikidata, the main doubts are about how trustfull the data is and in the case of claims with only {{P|143}} references we simply can't know. I think that the ideal solution would be updating those references.

Would you delete all sentences in Wikipedia articles with a \"citation needed\" tag?  Tools that query the data can easily add filters to hide unreferenced data or data that was only referenced to Wikipedia.  Perhaps another idea would be to consider adding an alert in the wikidata.org UI to notify users that claims are missing references (and thus should be treated with caution and could be improved by the user).

If I have a fact that \"John Smith was born 1 April 1650\" I have to identify which of all items is about my John Smith. The source here is maybe a very reliable one. But I probably have to look into the pages on Wikipedia to identify the correct item. If Wikipedia mixes the sons of mrs Smith, it then does not matter how reliable my source is. My statements will still be added in the wrong item.\n\nThis is one of the problems I am currently working with. Yesterday, I removed a number of statements from {{Q|25287}}. It was in properties like {{P|190}}, {{P|6}}, {{P|94}}, {{P|2046}}, {{P|1082}}. All of these statements were more or less correct, but they were all added to the wrong item. The English description of this item is \"Swedish city\". What even many Swedes then misses is that Q25287 is not at all about the \"City of Gothenburg\". It is about the urban area of Gothenburg. And urban areas do not have coat of arms, mayors or sister-citys. And the area and population of the Urban area is not the same as that for the City.\n\nSome of these statements were probably added by carbon based lifeforms, not by robots.

If the interwikis stem from the initial import in March/April 2013, the situation is probably messi and needs to be fixed before useful items are present. Before Wikidata, very different entities have been connected with each other by interwikis and many of these problems outlast until today. If you then import from different Wikipedias that have articles about different entities, it is ''of course'' a messi item then.

I rarely see property proposal discussions \"closed\" in the sense of using the Closed template or something of that sort. What generally happens is (A) an editing of the status field for the property to indicate either that the property has been created (entering the property number in that field), or some other status change such as \"withdrawn\" or \"not done\", and then at some time later (B) archiving the proposal to the relevant archive page. Changing the status to \"ready\" should indicate that all the property documentation fields are filled in (good examples, related item, formatter, etc) and consensus seems to have been reached in discussion and the property should be created. Anybody should be able to do B (archiving) - and it would be nice if a bot took care of it so humans didn't have to be involved at all. There's no careful evaluation needed for archiving, though I think it's best to leave a space of a few days before archiving to allow for any post-creation (or post-\"not done\") comments from participants. On (A) - the property creator should enter the newly created property's number in the status, so that pretty much has to be done by a property creator (it is Step 4 in the creation process). \"withdrawn\" should probably be entered only by the proposer though there are some cases where it seems obvious and anybody should be able to (for example the proposer adds a new replacement proposal on the same proposal page, but forgets to mark the first as withdrawn). I believe the main issue of concern is who should enter \"Not Done\". as a status. I would recommend that this be restricted to uninvolved property creators or admins, and ONLY on the basis of either * lack of consensus after significant discussion (roughly equal oppose vs support comments) OR * a complete lack of supporting comments after an extended period of time (whether or not there are any opposing comments). This has not perhaps been completely clear in the [[Wikidata:Property_creators|Guidelines]] but I would have interpreted a lack of supporting comments over an extended period of time as manifestly lacking in consensus - as it says now, \"Property creators should not create new properties unless consensus exists.\". [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:45, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n**There is a long-standing convention that \"Consensus is assumed when there's no evidence of disagreement.\" <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 10:54, 21 March 2016 (UTC)\n***This is an important point - could other admins and property creators please weigh in on how they have interpreted \"unless consensus exists\" in the context of property creation?

I assume Andy would have created the property? But we have many others currently in a similar state with no comments or supporting or opposing statements - should they be created, or archived as Not Done for lack of support?

Since it's a limited right and there are very good reasons for reasonably restricting the number of properties in Wikidata, it has seemed to me the requirement of consensus is something more than simple silence here. How do others feel?

Were many created without much discussion? I believe so but I'm not going to go digging up details for you. Unfortunately I have two major projects that just landed on my lap yesterday so I'm probably not going to have much time for wikidata stuff at all for a while. Please don't assume my lack of response means agreement. What we really need is a better consensus on the purposes behind property creation in the first place - what are we actually trying to do here? Structure data, yes. But we are trying to avoid the mess that dbpedia and freebase got into with huge numbers of unconnected statements. Good properties connect things together wonderfully. How do we ensure that we limit the created properties to ones that will be long-term useful? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:39, 25 March 2016 (UTC)\n******* \"''Exasperation''\"? There are a couple of editors making <s>trouble</s> a fuss over nothing, regarding a few properties for which plenty of data exists in Wikipedia or in external sites; but that has nothing to do with either this proposal, nor my question. I don't assume your lack of response means lack of agreement, far from it. It just shows a lack of evidence. Just as there is no evidence of your hypothetical unconnected statements or lack of long-term use with regard to the issues covered by this proposal. <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 18:26, 25 March 2016 (UTC)\n******** Andy, what is wrong with waiting to create a property until it will actually be used? There are clear benefits (as the things I mentioned above indicate) to keeping the number of properties relatively small. External ID's may be an exception to that going forward as long as they aren't things that may change or require maintenance, but even there I don't see a whole lot of point in creating a property and then waiting years before somebody uses it for more than 1 or 2 items. Presumably there is a reason why property creation is limited to certain trusted users. Maybe we can be clearer about what the underlying purpose is for that.

(2) the current collection of proposal pages is a mess - it's not clear where certain property proposals belong (imagine for instance an Authority control property for Places in a Natural Science area that consists of standardized terms) and some of them are so long (some proposals having extended discussions spanning years) that it becomes very hard to review and understand what's going on.

Right now we have 16 property proposal pages with the following distribution of new properties proposed: Generic (7) Authority control (22) Person (6) Organization and politics (9) Event (0) Creative work (4) Term (2) Space (0) Place (2) References (0) Unsorted (7) Sister projects (3) Economics (25) Transportation (9) Natural science (20) Property metadata (2). Distributing them according to the above suggestion would give just 6 pages with I believe the following distribution of proposals (allocating Authority control and Person and Org & Politics appropriately): \"Culture and the arts\" 22, \"Geographical\" 2 , \"History and society\" 20, \"Science, technology, and engineering (and mathematics)\" 54, \"Wikipedia (meta)\" 5,  \"Generic\" 15. I don't think that's a helpful distribution. In particular \"Geographical\" doesn't seem useful here - maybe merge with History and society? And the Science one is way too big, we'll be hitting Lua errors quickly. So I would split that. Maybe Generic and meta can merge also. 6 pages with around 20 proposals on each would be perfect. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:58, 7 April 2016 (UTC)\n*****::: What is the purpose of that sorting, exactly ? Does it really matter that it's balanced ? We probably will have a perpetual unbalanced proposal proportion because of shifting in focus of editors, needs, and because ''one proposal can call other in the same field''. If we seek balance we will constantly have to reorganize the property proposals. What we need is the most is readability and meaningful and useful organization. \n*****::: One of the feature I would <u>actually</u> want is not balance who seems purposeless by itself, except if there is an overflow of proposals that challenges mediawiki or this leads to a mess, but alignment of the type of datas to the sorting of the proposal. One could think of \"domain alignment\" : if a proposal is linked to a class of datas, for example \"date of birth\" links to human (but could be generalized), then the place where we put another property related to \"human\" should be the same. Because we don't really want to search all other the place the best place where to put properties. So we should have a crystal clear sorting process with readable rules. The problem is the same before or after the proposal : how do we find a property after the creation ? What are the entry points ? It would be really great if we could find a rule that applies in both cases. Why ? Because, just stay focused with the property proposals, it would avoid request for a duplicate. In short : we should think hard on how to link proposals to projects and to classes of items, in a \"not so messy\" way. I created a point that was intended to be a global entry point a while ago, in the sense that when you search for something you would find it by reading it and find the classes, the projects, the proposals and so on starting from the page [[Help:Modelling]]. With a moderate success for know but maybe it's time to rethink again all together because it seems the problem is still not solved :) <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:53, 8 April 2016 (UTC) \n*****:::: [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]]  - well I wasn't expecting it to be exactly and always balanced, but you are right that the balance does naturally shift over time, and sometimes quickly when a lot of new properties are needed in some area. I'm not quite sure if I understand what you are proposing though. Many properties have the {{Tld|Constraint:Type}} constraint implying that the property should only apply to items that are instances or subclasses of some principle class. Are you suggesting we group them according to that class they are being applied to? So there would be {{Q|5}} properties and then there's {{Q|386724}} and {{Q|2221906}} and {{Q|43229}} maybe. Is there a concrete short list of these that would cover most property proposals well? Or maybe the best approach is just to have some sort of monthly list of all proposals with pointers from relevant other lists (and wikiproject pages) as others seem to be suggesting here ??? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:38, 8 April 2016 (UTC)\n*****::::: {{Ping|ArthurPSmith}} I think that there is too many approaches already for (atually not really) sorting properties and that's finally a mess. The \"global list of properties\" fails for so many reasons that I don't think I have to detail. We have to rely on external tools that are starting to pile up for this to have a chance to work. The \"by domain of applications\" have a moderate success, mainly because this was a starting point but I think nobody is really totally satisfied with this. On the other hand regrouping by the classes of items the property applies is an approach that is omnipresent in the computing world. I'd like that for example we find a way to integrate initiative of mine like {{tl|property for this type}}\u00a0and the corresponding property. Then, as there is a set of properties that is appliable to a class of item, this is actually a natural way to sort properties as you note. Pulling we also have a natural way to sort the classes themselves : the class tree/hierarchy. I'd like that we use more those \"natural structure\" in our process. This would help to consistently develop the hierarchies, the classes themselves ... For example one stuff I think is not really good in our property proposal process is that it's not so easy, before proposing a property or reviewing it, is to see if there is a duplicate property that could be used. Mainly one our way to discover properties could be to create a proposal and wait for someone more involved to point us to a solution to our problem ... this is a massive loss of time because instead of searching for a solution, finding it, and add the statement, we have to wait the answers of someone to answer, and that can take days instead of minutes, at best, with the cost of entering a bureaucratic process. This is a massive failure of our organization. I really think that instead of tweaking the bureaucratic process, we should really best think of our global organization, in particular how to integrate better the different parts of the wikidata day to day work : creating projects, proposing properties, creating class hierarchies ... All this is actually too loosely coupled. We don't have working and consensual guidelines that could help us achieve that. <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:47, 9 April 2016 (UTC)\n\n:Do bear in mind that some editors are prepared to accuse other editors of \"hiding\" proposals, if they do not agree that the page on which the proposal was made is the correct one, even when the proposal gathered comments from other, uninvolved, editors, and remained visible for a period of months. <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 14:17, 22 March 2016 (UTC)\n::Perhaps the answer to that is to have properties proposed on e.g. monthly pages and pointers to them placed on various lists, e.g. the SSSI (England) ID I proposed could be linked to from pages relating to Authority control, environment, Places (and/or United Kingdom if we want that specific) and designations. People could then watchlist whichever topics they are interested in and get a notification whenever a property is proposed.

Because it's not that easy to find by yourself a property if you're a newcomer, or to have forgotten that a property existed, it's easy to miss something, so a good knowledge of Wikidata is crutial to take a good decision, avoid mistakes and gives good advices to property proposers. So I think what we should improve first is the review process. Pages are pretty hard to follow, it's easy to mix something, you must have all the pages in your watchlist, proposal are badly sorted with duplicates ... And it does not improve with times. \n:::Also the usage rule of some property are not always very clear, and a bad process (for users) have a lot of bad implications : users will avoid  a proposal and will more easily broaden the properties or misuse an existing property if it's too hard or take too much time or if the result is random.

Does silence = consensus? Does one person opposed despite many supporters mean stalemate? Can a property creator overrule seeming consensus by acting without entering the discussion at all?

I rarely see property proposal discussions \"closed\" in the sense of using the Closed template or something of that sort. What generally happens is (A) an editing of the status field for the property to indicate either that the property has been created (entering the property number in that field), or some other status change such as \"withdrawn\" or \"not done\", and then at some time later (B) archiving the proposal to the relevant archive page. Changing the status to \"ready\" should indicate that all the property documentation fields are filled in (good examples, related item, formatter, etc) and consensus seems to have been reached in discussion and the property should be created. Anybody should be able to do B (archiving) - and it would be nice if a bot took care of it so humans didn't have to be involved at all. There's no careful evaluation needed for archiving, though I think it's best to leave a space of a few days before archiving to allow for any post-creation (or post-\"not done\") comments from participants. On (A) - the property creator should enter the newly created property's number in the status, so that pretty much has to be done by a property creator (it is Step 4 in the creation process). \"withdrawn\" should probably be entered only by the proposer though there are some cases where it seems obvious and anybody should be able to (for example the proposer adds a new replacement proposal on the same proposal page, but forgets to mark the first as withdrawn). I believe the main issue of concern is who should enter \"Not Done\". as a status. I would recommend that this be restricted to uninvolved property creators or admins, and ONLY on the basis of either * lack of consensus after significant discussion (roughly equal oppose vs support comments) OR * a complete lack of supporting comments after an extended period of time (whether or not there are any opposing comments). This has not perhaps been completely clear in the [[Wikidata:Property_creators|Guidelines]] but I would have interpreted a lack of supporting comments over an extended period of time as manifestly lacking in consensus - as it says now, \"Property creators should not create new properties unless consensus exists.\". [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:45, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n**There is a long-standing convention that \"Consensus is assumed when there's no evidence of disagreement.\" <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 10:54, 21 March 2016 (UTC)\n***This is an important point - could other admins and property creators please weigh in on how they have interpreted \"unless consensus exists\" in the context of property creation?

Unfortunately I have two major projects that just landed on my lap yesterday so I'm probably not going to have much time for wikidata stuff at all for a while. Please don't assume my lack of response means agreement. What we really need is a better consensus on the purposes behind property creation in the first place - what are we actually trying to do here? Structure data, yes. But we are trying to avoid the mess that dbpedia and freebase got into with huge numbers of unconnected statements. Good properties connect things together wonderfully. How do we ensure that we limit the created properties to ones that will be long-term useful?

There are a couple of editors making <s>trouble</s> a fuss over nothing, regarding a few properties for which plenty of data exists in Wikipedia or in external sites; but that has nothing to do with either this proposal, nor my question.

There are clear benefits (as the things I mentioned above indicate) to keeping the number of properties relatively small. External ID's may be an exception to that going forward as long as they aren't things that may change or require maintenance, but even there I don't see a whole lot of point in creating a property and then waiting years before somebody uses it for more than 1 or 2 items. Presumably there is a reason why property creation is limited to certain trusted users. Maybe we can be clearer about what the underlying purpose is for that.

Note I have also removed \"Step 7\" on adding to the list of properties as it shouldn't be necessary and has definitely not been done consistently recently. Jura seems to think we need approval from every property creator and administrator before making these changes - I would have thought the normal wiki editing process was sufficient to reach consensus on this, but apparently more is required?

Some observations:\n* The process we call Property proposals won't work with \"you can't act on these proposals if you've discussed them/have an external COI\". We actually need ''more'' users with the latter issue, as they are the ones best able to decide a property's fit-for-purpose.\n* A general inactivity in regard to proposals is the predominant problem \"causing\" people to close their own proposals (as successful). Forcing a recusal does not fix that problem.\n** A time limit on a discussion may help, where if consensus is not obvious after some period of time, the discussion should simply be closed as unsuccessful.\n* I generally agree with {{ping|Ajraddatz|Thryduulf|Jklamo}} at [[#Recusal]].\nOther comments welcome on the general issue of recusal. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:06, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n:Regarding your second and final points, I reiterate that I only ever closed my own proposals once I had asked it if was OK to do so at project chat.

With some more clarification I and I expect other property creators would act more quickly on proposals that actually are ready, or help with those that seem to be having trouble getting there. I do regularly review the proposal pages but rarely find something in a state I consider sufficiently ready to act on. (2) the current collection of proposal pages is a mess - it's not clear where certain property proposals belong (imagine for instance an Authority control property for Places in a Natural Science area that consists of standardized terms) and some of them are so long (some proposals having extended discussions spanning years) that it becomes very hard to review and understand what's going on.

Alternatively, we can play around with e.g. putting ''all'' identifiers on one page and then everything else to other pages. This would help move the \"fasttrack\" properties to one page and the slower discussions retained on their current domain-pages.\n*****:* Person\n*****:** 5 identifiers: Merge to individual other spaces; 1 political item; merge to culture and arts\n*****:* Unsorted\n*****:** Sort them, duh.

Right now we have 16 property proposal pages with the following distribution of new properties proposed: Generic (7) Authority control (22) Person (6) Organization and politics (9) Event (0) Creative work (4) Term (2) Space (0) Place (2) References (0) Unsorted (7) Sister projects (3) Economics (25) Transportation (9) Natural science (20) Property metadata (2). Distributing them according to the above suggestion would give just 6 pages with I believe the following distribution of proposals (allocating Authority control and Person and Org & Politics appropriately): \"Culture and the arts\" 22, \"Geographical\" 2 , \"History and society\" 20, \"Science, technology, and engineering (and mathematics)\" 54, \"Wikipedia (meta)\" 5,  \"Generic\" 15. I don't think that's a helpful distribution. In particular \"Geographical\" doesn't seem useful here - maybe merge with History and society? And the Science one is way too big, we'll be hitting Lua errors quickly. So I would split that. Maybe Generic and meta can merge also. 6 pages with around 20 proposals on each would be perfect. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:58, 7 April 2016 (UTC)\n*****::: What is the purpose of that sorting, exactly ? Does it really matter that it's balanced ? We probably will have a perpetual unbalanced proposal proportion because of shifting in focus of editors, needs, and because ''one proposal can call other in the same field''. If we seek balance we will constantly have to reorganize the property proposals. What we need is the most is readability and meaningful and useful organization. \n*****::: One of the feature I would <u>actually</u> want is not balance who seems purposeless by itself, except if there is an overflow of proposals that challenges mediawiki or this leads to a mess, but alignment of the type of datas to the sorting of the proposal. One could think of \"domain alignment\" : if a proposal is linked to a class of datas, for example \"date of birth\" links to human (but could be generalized), then the place where we put another property related to \"human\" should be the same. Because we don't really want to search all other the place the best place where to put properties. So we should have a crystal clear sorting process with readable rules. The problem is the same before or after the proposal : how do we find a property after the creation ? What are the entry points ? It would be really great if we could find a rule that applies in both cases. Why ? Because, just stay focused with the property proposals, it would avoid request for a duplicate. In short : we should think hard on how to link proposals to projects and to classes of items, in a \"not so messy\" way. I created a point that was intended to be a global entry point a while ago, in the sense that when you search for something you would find it by reading it and find the classes, the projects, the proposals and so on starting from the page [[Help:Modelling]]. With a moderate success for know but maybe it's time to rethink again all together because it seems the problem is still not solved :) <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:53, 8 April 2016 (UTC) \n*****:::: [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]]  - well I wasn't expecting it to be exactly and always balanced, but you are right that the balance does naturally shift over time, and sometimes quickly when a lot of new properties are needed in some area. I'm not quite sure if I understand what you are proposing though. Many properties have the {{Tld|Constraint:Type}} constraint implying that the property should only apply to items that are instances or subclasses of some principle class. Are you suggesting we group them according to that class they are being applied to? So there would be {{Q|5}} properties and then there's {{Q|386724}} and {{Q|2221906}} and {{Q|43229}} maybe. Is there a concrete short list of these that would cover most property proposals well? Or maybe the best approach is just to have some sort of monthly list of all proposals with pointers from relevant other lists (and wikiproject pages) as others seem to be suggesting here ??? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:38, 8 April 2016 (UTC)\n*****::::: {{Ping|ArthurPSmith}} I think that there is too many approaches already for (atually not really) sorting properties and that's finally a mess. The \"global list of properties\" fails for so many reasons that I don't think I have to detail. We have to rely on external tools that are starting to pile up for this to have a chance to work. The \"by domain of applications\" have a moderate success, mainly because this was a starting point but I think nobody is really totally satisfied with this. On the other hand regrouping by the classes of items the property applies is an approach that is omnipresent in the computing world. I'd like that for example we find a way to integrate initiative of mine like {{tl|property for this type}}\u00a0and the corresponding property. Then, as there is a set of properties that is appliable to a class of item, this is actually a natural way to sort properties as you note. Pulling we also have a natural way to sort the classes themselves : the class tree/hierarchy. I'd like that we use more those \"natural structure\" in our process. This would help to consistently develop the hierarchies, the classes themselves ... For example one stuff I think is not really good in our property proposal process is that it's not so easy, before proposing a property or reviewing it, is to see if there is a duplicate property that could be used. Mainly one our way to discover properties could be to create a proposal and wait for someone more involved to point us to a solution to our problem ... this is a massive loss of time because instead of searching for a solution, finding it, and add the statement, we have to wait the answers of someone to answer, and that can take days instead of minutes, at best, with the cost of entering a bureaucratic process. This is a massive failure of our organization. I really think that instead of tweaking the bureaucratic process, we should really best think of our global organization, in particular how to integrate better the different parts of the wikidata day to day work : creating projects, proposing properties, creating class hierarchies ... All this is actually too loosely coupled. We don't have working and consensual guidelines that could help us achieve that. <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:47, 9 April 2016 (UTC)\n\n:Do bear in mind that some editors are prepared to accuse other editors of \"hiding\" proposals, if they do not agree that the page on which the proposal was made is the correct one, even when the proposal gathered comments from other, uninvolved, editors, and remained visible for a period of months. <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 14:17, 22 March 2016 (UTC)\n::Perhaps the answer to that is to have properties proposed on e.g. monthly pages and pointers to them placed on various lists, e.g. the SSSI (England) ID I proposed could be linked to from pages relating to Authority control, environment, Places (and/or United Kingdom if we want that specific) and designations. People could then watchlist whichever topics they are interested in and get a notification whenever a property is proposed.

Because it's not that easy to find by yourself a property if you're a newcomer, or to have forgotten that a property existed, it's easy to miss something, so a good knowledge of Wikidata is crutial to take a good decision, avoid mistakes and gives good advices to property proposers. So I think what we should improve first is the review process.

And it does not improve with times. \n:::Also the usage rule of some property are not always very clear, and a bad process (for users) have a lot of bad implications : users will avoid  a proposal and will more easily broaden the properties or misuse an existing property if it's too hard or take too much time or if the result is random.

I rarely see property proposal discussions \"closed\" in the sense of using the Closed template or something of that sort. What generally happens is (A) an editing of the status field for the property to indicate either that the property has been created (entering the property number in that field), or some other status change such as \"withdrawn\" or \"not done\", and then at some time later (B) archiving the proposal to the relevant archive page. Changing the status to \"ready\" should indicate that all the property documentation fields are filled in (good examples, related item, formatter, etc) and consensus seems to have been reached in discussion and the property should be created. Anybody should be able to do B (archiving) - and it would be nice if a bot took care of it so humans didn't have to be involved at all. There's no careful evaluation needed for archiving, though I think it's best to leave a space of a few days before archiving to allow for any post-creation (or post-\"not done\") comments from participants. On (A) - the property creator should enter the newly created property's number in the status, so that pretty much has to be done by a property creator (it is Step 4 in the creation process). \"withdrawn\" should probably be entered only by the proposer though there are some cases where it seems obvious and anybody should be able to (for example the proposer adds a new replacement proposal on the same proposal page, but forgets to mark the first as withdrawn). I believe the main issue of concern is who should enter \"Not Done\". as a status. I would recommend that this be restricted to uninvolved property creators or admins, and ONLY on the basis of either * lack of consensus after significant discussion (roughly equal oppose vs support comments) OR * a complete lack of supporting comments after an extended period of time (whether or not there are any opposing comments). This has not perhaps been completely clear in the [[Wikidata:Property_creators|Guidelines]] but I would have interpreted a lack of supporting comments over an extended period of time as manifestly lacking in consensus - as it says now, \"Property creators should not create new properties unless consensus exists.\".

Were many created without much discussion? I believe so but I'm not going to go digging up details for you. Unfortunately I have two major projects that just landed on my lap yesterday so I'm probably not going to have much time for wikidata stuff at all for a while. Please don't assume my lack of response means agreement. What we really need is a better consensus on the purposes behind property creation in the first place - what are we actually trying to do here? Structure data, yes. But we are trying to avoid the mess that dbpedia and freebase got into with huge numbers of unconnected statements. Good properties connect things together wonderfully. How do we ensure that we limit the created properties to ones that will be long-term useful? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:39, 25 March 2016 (UTC)\n******* \"''Exasperation''\"? There are a couple of editors making <s>trouble</s> a fuss over nothing, regarding a few properties for which plenty of data exists in Wikipedia or in external sites; but that has nothing to do with either this proposal, nor my question. I don't assume your lack of response means lack of agreement, far from it. It just shows a lack of evidence. Just as there is no evidence of your hypothetical unconnected statements or lack of long-term use with regard to the issues covered by this proposal. <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 18:26, 25 March 2016 (UTC)\n******** Andy, what is wrong with waiting to create a property until it will actually be used? There are clear benefits (as the things I mentioned above indicate) to keeping the number of properties relatively small. External ID's may be an exception to that going forward as long as they aren't things that may change or require maintenance, but even there I don't see a whole lot of point in creating a property and then waiting years before somebody uses it for more than 1 or 2 items. Presumably there is a reason why property creation is limited to certain trusted users. Maybe we can be clearer about what the underlying purpose is for that.

With some more clarification I and I expect other property creators would act more quickly on proposals that actually are ready, or help with those that seem to be having trouble getting there. I do regularly review the proposal pages but rarely find something in a state I consider sufficiently ready to act on. (2) the current collection of proposal pages is a mess - it's not clear where certain property proposals belong (imagine for instance an Authority control property for Places in a Natural Science area that consists of standardized terms) and some of them are so long (some proposals having extended discussions spanning years) that it becomes very hard to review and understand what's going on.

Right now we have 16 property proposal pages with the following distribution of new properties proposed: Generic (7) Authority control (22) Person (6) Organization and politics (9) Event (0) Creative work (4) Term (2) Space (0) Place (2) References (0) Unsorted (7) Sister projects (3) Economics (25) Transportation (9) Natural science (20) Property metadata (2). Distributing them according to the above suggestion would give just 6 pages with I believe the following distribution of proposals (allocating Authority control and Person and Org & Politics appropriately): \"Culture and the arts\" 22, \"Geographical\" 2 , \"History and society\" 20, \"Science, technology, and engineering (and mathematics)\" 54, \"Wikipedia (meta)\" 5,  \"Generic\" 15. I don't think that's a helpful distribution. In particular \"Geographical\" doesn't seem useful here - maybe merge with History and society? And the Science one is way too big, we'll be hitting Lua errors quickly. So I would split that. Maybe Generic and meta can merge also. 6 pages with around 20 proposals on each would be perfect. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:58, 7 April 2016 (UTC)\n*****::: What is the purpose of that sorting, exactly ? Does it really matter that it's balanced ? We probably will have a perpetual unbalanced proposal proportion because of shifting in focus of editors, needs, and because ''one proposal can call other in the same field''. If we seek balance we will constantly have to reorganize the property proposals. What we need is the most is readability and meaningful and useful organization. \n*****::: One of the feature I would <u>actually</u> want is not balance who seems purposeless by itself, except if there is an overflow of proposals that challenges mediawiki or this leads to a mess, but alignment of the type of datas to the sorting of the proposal. One could think of \"domain alignment\" : if a proposal is linked to a class of datas, for example \"date of birth\" links to human (but could be generalized), then the place where we put another property related to \"human\" should be the same. Because we don't really want to search all other the place the best place where to put properties. So we should have a crystal clear sorting process with readable rules. The problem is the same before or after the proposal : how do we find a property after the creation ? What are the entry points ? It would be really great if we could find a rule that applies in both cases. Why ? Because, just stay focused with the property proposals, it would avoid request for a duplicate. In short : we should think hard on how to link proposals to projects and to classes of items, in a \"not so messy\" way. I created a point that was intended to be a global entry point a while ago, in the sense that when you search for something you would find it by reading it and find the classes, the projects, the proposals and so on starting from the page [[Help:Modelling]]. With a moderate success for know but maybe it's time to rethink again all together because it seems the problem is still not solved :) <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:53, 8 April 2016 (UTC) \n*****:::: [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]]  - well I wasn't expecting it to be exactly and always balanced, but you are right that the balance does naturally shift over time, and sometimes quickly when a lot of new properties are needed in some area. I'm not quite sure if I understand what you are proposing though. Many properties have the {{Tld|Constraint:Type}} constraint implying that the property should only apply to items that are instances or subclasses of some principle class. Are you suggesting we group them according to that class they are being applied to? So there would be {{Q|5}} properties and then there's {{Q|386724}} and {{Q|2221906}} and {{Q|43229}} maybe. Is there a concrete short list of these that would cover most property proposals well? Or maybe the best approach is just to have some sort of monthly list of all proposals with pointers from relevant other lists (and wikiproject pages) as others seem to be suggesting here ??? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:38, 8 April 2016 (UTC)\n*****::::: {{Ping|ArthurPSmith}} I think that there is too many approaches already for (atually not really) sorting properties and that's finally a mess. The \"global list of properties\" fails for so many reasons that I don't think I have to detail. We have to rely on external tools that are starting to pile up for this to have a chance to work. The \"by domain of applications\" have a moderate success, mainly because this was a starting point but I think nobody is really totally satisfied with this. On the other hand regrouping by the classes of items the property applies is an approach that is omnipresent in the computing world. I'd like that for example we find a way to integrate initiative of mine like {{tl|property for this type}}\u00a0and the corresponding property. Then, as there is a set of properties that is appliable to a class of item, this is actually a natural way to sort properties as you note. Pulling we also have a natural way to sort the classes themselves : the class tree/hierarchy. I'd like that we use more those \"natural structure\" in our process. This would help to consistently develop the hierarchies, the classes themselves ... For example one stuff I think is not really good in our property proposal process is that it's not so easy, before proposing a property or reviewing it, is to see if there is a duplicate property that could be used. Mainly one our way to discover properties could be to create a proposal and wait for someone more involved to point us to a solution to our problem ... this is a massive loss of time because instead of searching for a solution, finding it, and add the statement, we have to wait the answers of someone to answer, and that can take days instead of minutes, at best, with the cost of entering a bureaucratic process. This is a massive failure of our organization. I really think that instead of tweaking the bureaucratic process, we should really best think of our global organization, in particular how to integrate better the different parts of the wikidata day to day work : creating projects, proposing properties, creating class hierarchies ... All this is actually too loosely coupled. We don't have working and consensual guidelines that could help us achieve that. <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:47, 9 April 2016 (UTC)\n\n:Do bear in mind that some editors are prepared to accuse other editors of \"hiding\" proposals, if they do not agree that the page on which the proposal was made is the correct one, even when the proposal gathered comments from other, uninvolved, editors, and remained visible for a period of months. <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 14:17, 22 March 2016 (UTC)\n::Perhaps the answer to that is to have properties proposed on e.g. monthly pages and pointers to them placed on various lists, e.g. the SSSI (England) ID I proposed could be linked to from pages relating to Authority control, environment, Places (and/or United Kingdom if we want that specific) and designations.

It's important, but ... what about the proposers themselves ? Don't we risk that we end up with an optimized process for the creators but that the consumers are totally forgotten and are actually discouraged to propose something ?  <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:11, 23 March 2016 (UTC)\n::I've made all my comments on this page from the PoV of a PC, obviously, but I've tried to keep proposers in mind, and suggest things that will make life easier for them.

Because it's not that easy to find by yourself a property if you're a newcomer, or to have forgotten that a property existed, it's easy to miss something, so a good knowledge of Wikidata is crutial to take a good decision, avoid mistakes and gives good advices to property proposers. So I think what we should improve first is the review process. Pages are pretty hard to follow, it's easy to mix something, you must have all the pages in your watchlist, proposal are badly sorted with duplicates ... And it does not improve with times. \n:::Also the usage rule of some property are not always very clear, and a bad process (for users) have a lot of bad implications : users will avoid  a proposal and will more easily broaden the properties or misuse an existing property if it's too hard or take too much time or if the result is random. From what I can see, the rumour that the process in Wikidata is too bureaucratic already spread out. {{Unsigned | TomT0m | 12:15, 23 March 2016\u200e }}\n::::Thank you.

I rarely see property proposal discussions \"closed\" in the sense of using the Closed template or something of that sort. What generally happens is (A) an editing of the status field for the property to indicate either that the property has been created (entering the property number in that field), or some other status change such as \"withdrawn\" or \"not done\", and then at some time later (B) archiving the proposal to the relevant archive page. Changing the status to \"ready\" should indicate that all the property documentation fields are filled in (good examples, related item, formatter, etc) and consensus seems to have been reached in discussion and the property should be created. Anybody should be able to do B (archiving) - and it would be nice if a bot took care of it so humans didn't have to be involved at all. There's no careful evaluation needed for archiving, though I think it's best to leave a space of a few days before archiving to allow for any post-creation (or post-\"not done\") comments from participants. On (A) - the property creator should enter the newly created property's number in the status, so that pretty much has to be done by a property creator (it is Step 4 in the creation process). \"withdrawn\" should probably be entered only by the proposer though there are some cases where it seems obvious and anybody should be able to (for example the proposer adds a new replacement proposal on the same proposal page, but forgets to mark the first as withdrawn). I believe the main issue of concern is who should enter \"Not Done\". as a status. I would recommend that this be restricted to uninvolved property creators or admins, and ONLY on the basis of either * lack of consensus after significant discussion (roughly equal oppose vs support comments) OR * a complete lack of supporting comments after an extended period of time (whether or not there are any opposing comments). This has not perhaps been completely clear in the [[Wikidata:Property_creators|Guidelines]] but I would have interpreted a lack of supporting comments over an extended period of time as manifestly lacking in consensus - as it says now, \"Property creators should not create new properties unless consensus exists.\". [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:45, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n**There is a long-standing convention that \"Consensus is assumed when there's no evidence of disagreement.\" <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 10:54, 21 March 2016 (UTC)\n***This is an important point - could other admins and property creators please weigh in on how they have interpreted \"unless consensus exists\" in the context of property creation? I note for example that [[User:Micru|Micru]] closed [[Wikidata:Property_proposal/Archive/45#ASF_KID_Cave_Tag_Number|this discussion]] as \"Not Done\" with the note \"Lack of Support\" after several months and no comments of any sort. I assume Andy would have created the property? But we have many others currently in a similar state with no comments or supporting or opposing statements - should they be created, or archived as Not Done for lack of support? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:32, 21 March 2016 (UTC) -- addendum - Andy seems to be referring to [[:en:Wikipedia:Silence_and_consensus]] but note that it states \"Silence and consensus does not apply when either a strong consensus or a mandatory discussion is required.\" - how does this apply in the case of property creation? Since it's a limited right and there are very good reasons for reasonably restricting the number of properties in Wikidata, it has seemed to me the requirement of consensus is something more than simple silence here. How do others feel? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:55, 21 March 2016 (UTC)\n****How many cases have there been, of properties being deleted, or at least nominated for deletion, or issues raised at project chat/ admin noticeboard, because they were created after a \"no evidence of disagreement\" type decision?

Were many created without much discussion? I believe so but I'm not going to go digging up details for you. Unfortunately I have two major projects that just landed on my lap yesterday so I'm probably not going to have much time for wikidata stuff at all for a while. Please don't assume my lack of response means agreement. What we really need is a better consensus on the purposes behind property creation in the first place - what are we actually trying to do here? Structure data, yes. But we are trying to avoid the mess that dbpedia and freebase got into with huge numbers of unconnected statements. Good properties connect things together wonderfully. How do we ensure that we limit the created properties to ones that will be long-term useful? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:39, 25 March 2016 (UTC)\n******* \"''Exasperation''\"? There are a couple of editors making <s>trouble</s> a fuss over nothing, regarding a few properties for which plenty of data exists in Wikipedia or in external sites; but that has nothing to do with either this proposal, nor my question. I don't assume your lack of response means lack of agreement, far from it. It just shows a lack of evidence. Just as there is no evidence of your hypothetical unconnected statements or lack of long-term use with regard to the issues covered by this proposal. <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 18:26, 25 March 2016 (UTC)\n******** Andy, what is wrong with waiting to create a property until it will actually be used? There are clear benefits (as the things I mentioned above indicate) to keeping the number of properties relatively small. External ID's may be an exception to that going forward as long as they aren't things that may change or require maintenance, but even there I don't see a whole lot of point in creating a property and then waiting years before somebody uses it for more than 1 or 2 items. Presumably there is a reason why property creation is limited to certain trusted users. Maybe we can be clearer about what the underlying purpose is for that.

We actually need ''more'' users with the latter issue, as they are the ones best able to decide a property's fit-for-purpose.\n* A general inactivity in regard to proposals is the predominant problem \"causing\" people to close their own proposals (as successful). Forcing a recusal does not fix that problem.\n** A time limit on a discussion may help, where if consensus is not obvious after some period of time, the discussion should simply be closed as unsuccessful.\n* I generally agree with {{ping|Ajraddatz|Thryduulf|Jklamo}} at [[#Recusal]].\nOther comments welcome on the general issue of recusal. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:06, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n:Regarding your second and final points, I reiterate that I only ever closed my own proposals once I had asked it if was OK to do so at project chat.

I do regularly review the proposal pages but rarely find something in a state I consider sufficiently ready to act on. (2) the current collection of proposal pages is a mess - it's not clear where certain property proposals belong (imagine for instance an Authority control property for Places in a Natural Science area that consists of standardized terms) and some of them are so long (some proposals having extended discussions spanning years) that it becomes very hard to review and understand what's going on.

I don't think that's a helpful distribution. In particular \"Geographical\" doesn't seem useful here - maybe merge with History and society?

What we need is the most is readability and meaningful and useful organization. \n*****::: One of the feature I would <u>actually</u> want is not balance who seems purposeless by itself, except if there is an overflow of proposals that challenges mediawiki or this leads to a mess, but alignment of the type of datas to the sorting of the proposal. One could think of \"domain alignment\" : if a proposal is linked to a class of datas, for example \"date of birth\" links to human (but could be generalized), then the place where we put another property related to \"human\" should be the same. Because we don't really want to search all other the place the best place where to put properties. So we should have a crystal clear sorting process with readable rules. The problem is the same before or after the proposal : how do we find a property after the creation ? What are the entry points ? It would be really great if we could find a rule that applies in both cases. Why ? Because, just stay focused with the property proposals, it would avoid request for a duplicate. In short : we should think hard on how to link proposals to projects and to classes of items, in a \"not so messy\" way. I created a point that was intended to be a global entry point a while ago, in the sense that when you search for something you would find it by reading it and find the classes, the projects, the proposals and so on starting from the page [[Help:Modelling]]. With a moderate success for know but maybe it's time to rethink again all together because it seems the problem is still not solved :) <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:53, 8 April 2016 (UTC) \n*****:::: [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]]  - well I wasn't expecting it to be exactly and always balanced, but you are right that the balance does naturally shift over time, and sometimes quickly when a lot of new properties are needed in some area. I'm not quite sure if I understand what you are proposing though. Many properties have the {{Tld|Constraint:Type}} constraint implying that the property should only apply to items that are instances or subclasses of some principle class. Are you suggesting we group them according to that class they are being applied to? So there would be {{Q|5}} properties and then there's {{Q|386724}} and {{Q|2221906}} and {{Q|43229}} maybe. Is there a concrete short list of these that would cover most property proposals well? Or maybe the best approach is just to have some sort of monthly list of all proposals with pointers from relevant other lists (and wikiproject pages) as others seem to be suggesting here ??? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:38, 8 April 2016 (UTC)\n*****::::: {{Ping|ArthurPSmith}} I think that there is too many approaches already for (atually not really) sorting properties and that's finally a mess. The \"global list of properties\" fails for so many reasons that I don't think I have to detail. We have to rely on external tools that are starting to pile up for this to have a chance to work. The \"by domain of applications\" have a moderate success, mainly because this was a starting point but I think nobody is really totally satisfied with this. On the other hand regrouping by the classes of items the property applies is an approach that is omnipresent in the computing world. I'd like that for example we find a way to integrate initiative of mine like {{tl|property for this type}}\u00a0and the corresponding property. Then, as there is a set of properties that is appliable to a class of item, this is actually a natural way to sort properties as you note. Pulling we also have a natural way to sort the classes themselves : the class tree/hierarchy. I'd like that we use more those \"natural structure\" in our process. This would help to consistently develop the hierarchies, the classes themselves ... For example one stuff I think is not really good in our property proposal process is that it's not so easy, before proposing a property or reviewing it, is to see if there is a duplicate property that could be used. Mainly one our way to discover properties could be to create a proposal and wait for someone more involved to point us to a solution to our problem ... this is a massive loss of time because instead of searching for a solution, finding it, and add the statement, we have to wait the answers of someone to answer, and that can take days instead of minutes, at best, with the cost of entering a bureaucratic process. This is a massive failure of our organization. I really think that instead of tweaking the bureaucratic process, we should really best think of our global organization, in particular how to integrate better the different parts of the wikidata day to day work : creating projects, proposing properties, creating class hierarchies ... All this is actually too loosely coupled. We don't have working and consensual guidelines that could help us achieve that. <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:47, 9 April 2016 (UTC)\n\n:Do bear in mind that some editors are prepared to accuse other editors of \"hiding\" proposals, if they do not agree that the page on which the proposal was made is the correct one, even when the proposal gathered comments from other, uninvolved, editors, and remained visible for a period of months. <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 14:17, 22 March 2016 (UTC)\n::Perhaps the answer to that is to have properties proposed on e.g. monthly pages and pointers to them placed on various lists, e.g. the SSSI (England) ID I proposed could be linked to from pages relating to Authority control, environment, Places (and/or United Kingdom if we want that specific) and designations. People could then watchlist whichever topics they are interested in and get a notification whenever a property is proposed.

It's important, but ... what about the proposers themselves ? Don't we risk that we end up with an optimized process for the creators but that the consumers are totally forgotten and are actually discouraged to propose something ?  <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:11, 23 March 2016 (UTC)\n::I've made all my comments on this page from the PoV of a PC, obviously, but I've tried to keep proposers in mind, and suggest things that will make life easier for them.

Because it's not that easy to find by yourself a property if you're a newcomer, or to have forgotten that a property existed, it's easy to miss something, so a good knowledge of Wikidata is crutial to take a good decision, avoid mistakes and gives good advices to property proposers. So I think what we should improve first is the review process. Pages are pretty hard to follow, it's easy to mix something, you must have all the pages in your watchlist, proposal are badly sorted with duplicates ... And it does not improve with times. \n:::Also the usage rule of some property are not always very clear, and a bad process (for users) have a lot of bad implications : users will avoid  a proposal and will more easily broaden the properties or misuse an existing property if it's too hard or take too much time or if the result is random.

Does silence = consensus? Does one person opposed despite many supporters mean stalemate? Can a property creator overrule seeming consensus by acting without entering the discussion at all?

I rarely see property proposal discussions \"closed\" in the sense of using the Closed template or something of that sort. What generally happens is (A) an editing of the status field for the property to indicate either that the property has been created (entering the property number in that field), or some other status change such as \"withdrawn\" or \"not done\", and then at some time later (B) archiving the proposal to the relevant archive page. Changing the status to \"ready\" should indicate that all the property documentation fields are filled in (good examples, related item, formatter, etc) and consensus seems to have been reached in discussion and the property should be created. Anybody should be able to do B (archiving) - and it would be nice if a bot took care of it so humans didn't have to be involved at all. There's no careful evaluation needed for archiving, though I think it's best to leave a space of a few days before archiving to allow for any post-creation (or post-\"not done\") comments from participants. On (A) - the property creator should enter the newly created property's number in the status, so that pretty much has to be done by a property creator (it is Step 4 in the creation process). \"withdrawn\" should probably be entered only by the proposer though there are some cases where it seems obvious and anybody should be able to (for example the proposer adds a new replacement proposal on the same proposal page, but forgets to mark the first as withdrawn). I believe the main issue of concern is who should enter \"Not Done\". as a status. I would recommend that this be restricted to uninvolved property creators or admins, and ONLY on the basis of either * lack of consensus after significant discussion (roughly equal oppose vs support comments) OR * a complete lack of supporting comments after an extended period of time (whether or not there are any opposing comments). This has not perhaps been completely clear in the [[Wikidata:Property_creators|Guidelines]] but I would have interpreted a lack of supporting comments over an extended period of time as manifestly lacking in consensus - as it says now, \"Property creators should not create new properties unless consensus exists.\". [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:45, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n**There is a long-standing convention that \"Consensus is assumed when there's no evidence of disagreement.\" <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 10:54, 21 March 2016 (UTC)\n***This is an important point - could other admins and property creators please weigh in on how they have interpreted \"unless consensus exists\" in the context of property creation?

Were many created without much discussion? I believe so but I'm not going to go digging up details for you. Unfortunately I have two major projects that just landed on my lap yesterday so I'm probably not going to have much time for wikidata stuff at all for a while. Please don't assume my lack of response means agreement. What we really need is a better consensus on the purposes behind property creation in the first place - what are we actually trying to do here? Structure data, yes. But we are trying to avoid the mess that dbpedia and freebase got into with huge numbers of unconnected statements. Good properties connect things together wonderfully. How do we ensure that we limit the created properties to ones that will be long-term useful?

There are a couple of editors making <s>trouble</s> a fuss over nothing, regarding a few properties for which plenty of data exists in Wikipedia or in external sites; but that has nothing to do with either this proposal, nor my question. I don't assume your lack of response means lack of agreement, far from it. It just shows a lack of evidence. Just as there is no evidence of your hypothetical unconnected statements or lack of long-term use with regard to the issues covered by this proposal. <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 18:26, 25 March 2016 (UTC)\n******** Andy, what is wrong with waiting to create a property until it will actually be used? There are clear benefits (as the things I mentioned above indicate) to keeping the number of properties relatively small. External ID's may be an exception to that going forward as long as they aren't things that may change or require maintenance, but even there I don't see a whole lot of point in creating a property and then waiting years before somebody uses it for more than 1 or 2 items. Presumably there is a reason why property creation is limited to certain trusted users. Maybe we can be clearer about what the underlying purpose is for that.

With some more clarification I and I expect other property creators would act more quickly on proposals that actually are ready, or help with those that seem to be having trouble getting there. I do regularly review the proposal pages but rarely find something in a state I consider sufficiently ready to act on. (2) the current collection of proposal pages is a mess - it's not clear where certain property proposals belong (imagine for instance an Authority control property for Places in a Natural Science area that consists of standardized terms) and some of them are so long (some proposals having extended discussions spanning years) that it becomes very hard to review and understand what's going on.

Obviously properties are multifaceted and could be organized many different ways, but properties with the same datatype do tend to have things in common (particularly for special datatypes like geographic coordinates or mathematical formulas). And this has the advantage of being an exclusive feature to organize on - you know exactly where the proposal belongs once you know what datatype the property should use.

Alternatively, we can play around with e.g. putting ''all'' identifiers on one page and then everything else to other pages. This would help move the \"fasttrack\" properties to one page and the slower discussions retained on their current domain-pages.\n*****:* Person\n*****:** 5 identifiers: Merge to individual other spaces; 1 political item; merge to culture and arts\n*****:* Unsorted\n*****:** Sort them, duh. These should be merged to Generic, regardless of any re-org.\n*****: Of course, we can also decide as we're moving them around that certain proposals should be on certain pages, but I think that's the gist of it. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:43, 22 March 2016 (UTC)\n*****:: [[User:Izno|Izno]] - maybe, but I'm wondering how you expect \"Organization and politics\" to work if it's duplicated?

Right now we have 16 property proposal pages with the following distribution of new properties proposed: Generic (7) Authority control (22) Person (6) Organization and politics (9) Event (0) Creative work (4) Term (2) Space (0) Place (2) References (0) Unsorted (7) Sister projects (3) Economics (25) Transportation (9) Natural science (20) Property metadata (2). Distributing them according to the above suggestion would give just 6 pages with I believe the following distribution of proposals (allocating Authority control and Person and Org & Politics appropriately): \"Culture and the arts\" 22, \"Geographical\" 2 , \"History and society\" 20, \"Science, technology, and engineering (and mathematics)\" 54, \"Wikipedia (meta)\" 5,  \"Generic\" 15. I don't think that's a helpful distribution. In particular \"Geographical\" doesn't seem useful here - maybe merge with History and society? And the Science one is way too big, we'll be hitting Lua errors quickly. So I would split that. Maybe Generic and meta can merge also. 6 pages with around 20 proposals on each would be perfect. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:58, 7 April 2016 (UTC)\n*****::: What is the purpose of that sorting, exactly ? Does it really matter that it's balanced ? We probably will have a perpetual unbalanced proposal proportion because of shifting in focus of editors, needs, and because ''one proposal can call other in the same field''. If we seek balance we will constantly have to reorganize the property proposals. What we need is the most is readability and meaningful and useful organization. \n*****::: One of the feature I would <u>actually</u> want is not balance who seems purposeless by itself, except if there is an overflow of proposals that challenges mediawiki or this leads to a mess, but alignment of the type of datas to the sorting of the proposal. One could think of \"domain alignment\" : if a proposal is linked to a class of datas, for example \"date of birth\" links to human (but could be generalized), then the place where we put another property related to \"human\" should be the same. Because we don't really want to search all other the place the best place where to put properties. So we should have a crystal clear sorting process with readable rules. The problem is the same before or after the proposal : how do we find a property after the creation ? What are the entry points ? It would be really great if we could find a rule that applies in both cases. Why ? Because, just stay focused with the property proposals, it would avoid request for a duplicate. In short : we should think hard on how to link proposals to projects and to classes of items, in a \"not so messy\" way. I created a point that was intended to be a global entry point a while ago, in the sense that when you search for something you would find it by reading it and find the classes, the projects, the proposals and so on starting from the page [[Help:Modelling]]. With a moderate success for know but maybe it's time to rethink again all together because it seems the problem is still not solved :) <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:53, 8 April 2016 (UTC) \n*****:::: [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]]  - well I wasn't expecting it to be exactly and always balanced, but you are right that the balance does naturally shift over time, and sometimes quickly when a lot of new properties are needed in some area. I'm not quite sure if I understand what you are proposing though. Many properties have the {{Tld|Constraint:Type}} constraint implying that the property should only apply to items that are instances or subclasses of some principle class. Are you suggesting we group them according to that class they are being applied to? So there would be {{Q|5}} properties and then there's {{Q|386724}} and {{Q|2221906}} and {{Q|43229}} maybe. Is there a concrete short list of these that would cover most property proposals well? Or maybe the best approach is just to have some sort of monthly list of all proposals with pointers from relevant other lists (and wikiproject pages) as others seem to be suggesting here ??? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:38, 8 April 2016 (UTC)\n*****::::: {{Ping|ArthurPSmith}} I think that there is too many approaches already for (atually not really) sorting properties and that's finally a mess. The \"global list of properties\" fails for so many reasons that I don't think I have to detail. We have to rely on external tools that are starting to pile up for this to have a chance to work. The \"by domain of applications\" have a moderate success, mainly because this was a starting point but I think nobody is really totally satisfied with this. On the other hand regrouping by the classes of items the property applies is an approach that is omnipresent in the computing world. I'd like that for example we find a way to integrate initiative of mine like {{tl|property for this type}}\u00a0and the corresponding property. Then, as there is a set of properties that is appliable to a class of item, this is actually a natural way to sort properties as you note. Pulling we also have a natural way to sort the classes themselves : the class tree/hierarchy. I'd like that we use more those \"natural structure\" in our process. This would help to consistently develop the hierarchies, the classes themselves ... For example one stuff I think is not really good in our property proposal process is that it's not so easy, before proposing a property or reviewing it, is to see if there is a duplicate property that could be used. Mainly one our way to discover properties could be to create a proposal and wait for someone more involved to point us to a solution to our problem ... this is a massive loss of time because instead of searching for a solution, finding it, and add the statement, we have to wait the answers of someone to answer, and that can take days instead of minutes, at best, with the cost of entering a bureaucratic process. This is a massive failure of our organization. I really think that instead of tweaking the bureaucratic process, we should really best think of our global organization, in particular how to integrate better the different parts of the wikidata day to day work : creating projects, proposing properties, creating class hierarchies ... All this is actually too loosely coupled. We don't have working and consensual guidelines that could help us achieve that. <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:47, 9 April 2016 (UTC)\n\n:Do bear in mind that some editors are prepared to accuse other editors of \"hiding\" proposals, if they do not agree that the page on which the proposal was made is the correct one, even when the proposal gathered comments from other, uninvolved, editors, and remained visible for a period of months. <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 14:17, 22 March 2016 (UTC)\n::Perhaps the answer to that is to have properties proposed on e.g. monthly pages and pointers to them placed on various lists, e.g. the SSSI (England) ID I proposed could be linked to from pages relating to Authority control, environment, Places (and/or United Kingdom if we want that specific) and designations. People could then watchlist whichever topics they are interested in and get a notification whenever a property is proposed. I'm thinking something similar to en.wikipedia's [[w:wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting|Deletion sorting project]].

Because it's not that easy to find by yourself a property if you're a newcomer, or to have forgotten that a property existed, it's easy to miss something, so a good knowledge of Wikidata is crutial to take a good decision, avoid mistakes and gives good advices to property proposers. So I think what we should improve first is the review process. Pages are pretty hard to follow, it's easy to mix something, you must have all the pages in your watchlist, proposal are badly sorted with duplicates ... And it does not improve with times. \n:::Also the usage rule of some property are not always very clear, and a bad process (for users) have a lot of bad implications : users will avoid  a proposal and will more easily broaden the properties or misuse an existing property if it's too hard or take too much time or if the result is random.

I rarely see property proposal discussions \"closed\" in the sense of using the Closed template or something of that sort. What generally happens is (A) an editing of the status field for the property to indicate either that the property has been created (entering the property number in that field), or some other status change such as \"withdrawn\" or \"not done\", and then at some time later (B) archiving the proposal to the relevant archive page. Changing the status to \"ready\" should indicate that all the property documentation fields are filled in (good examples, related item, formatter, etc) and consensus seems to have been reached in discussion and the property should be created. Anybody should be able to do B (archiving) - and it would be nice if a bot took care of it so humans didn't have to be involved at all. There's no careful evaluation needed for archiving, though I think it's best to leave a space of a few days before archiving to allow for any post-creation (or post-\"not done\") comments from participants. On (A) - the property creator should enter the newly created property's number in the status, so that pretty much has to be done by a property creator (it is Step 4 in the creation process). \"withdrawn\" should probably be entered only by the proposer though there are some cases where it seems obvious and anybody should be able to (for example the proposer adds a new replacement proposal on the same proposal page, but forgets to mark the first as withdrawn). I believe the main issue of concern is who should enter \"Not Done\". as a status. I would recommend that this be restricted to uninvolved property creators or admins, and ONLY on the basis of either * lack of consensus after significant discussion (roughly equal oppose vs support comments) OR * a complete lack of supporting comments after an extended period of time (whether or not there are any opposing comments). This has not perhaps been completely clear in the [[Wikidata:Property_creators|Guidelines]] but I would have interpreted a lack of supporting comments over an extended period of time as manifestly lacking in consensus - as it says now, \"Property creators should not create new properties unless consensus exists.\".

Unfortunately I have two major projects that just landed on my lap yesterday so I'm probably not going to have much time for wikidata stuff at all for a while. Please don't assume my lack of response means agreement. What we really need is a better consensus on the purposes behind property creation in the first place - what are we actually trying to do here? Structure data, yes. But we are trying to avoid the mess that dbpedia and freebase got into with huge numbers of unconnected statements. Good properties connect things together wonderfully.

There are clear benefits (as the things I mentioned above indicate) to keeping the number of properties relatively small. External ID's may be an exception to that going forward as long as they aren't things that may change or require maintenance, but even there I don't see a whole lot of point in creating a property and then waiting years before somebody uses it for more than 1 or 2 items.

We actually need ''more'' users with the latter issue, as they are the ones best able to decide a property's fit-for-purpose.\n* A general inactivity in regard to proposals is the predominant problem \"causing\" people to close their own proposals (as successful). Forcing a recusal does not fix that problem.\n** A time limit on a discussion may help, where if consensus is not obvious after some period of time, the discussion should simply be closed as unsuccessful.\n* I generally agree with {{ping|Ajraddatz|Thryduulf|Jklamo}} at [[#Recusal]].\nOther comments welcome on the general issue of recusal. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:06, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n:Regarding your second and final points, I reiterate that I only ever closed my own proposals once I had asked it if was OK to do so at project chat.

With some more clarification I and I expect other property creators would act more quickly on proposals that actually are ready, or help with those that seem to be having trouble getting there. I do regularly review the proposal pages but rarely find something in a state I consider sufficiently ready to act on. (2) the current collection of proposal pages is a mess - it's not clear where certain property proposals belong (imagine for instance an Authority control property for Places in a Natural Science area that consists of standardized terms) and some of them are so long (some proposals having extended discussions spanning years) that it becomes very hard to review and understand what's going on.

Right now we have 16 property proposal pages with the following distribution of new properties proposed: Generic (7) Authority control (22) Person (6) Organization and politics (9) Event (0) Creative work (4) Term (2) Space (0) Place (2) References (0) Unsorted (7) Sister projects (3) Economics (25) Transportation (9) Natural science (20) Property metadata (2). Distributing them according to the above suggestion would give just 6 pages with I believe the following distribution of proposals (allocating Authority control and Person and Org & Politics appropriately): \"Culture and the arts\" 22, \"Geographical\" 2 , \"History and society\" 20, \"Science, technology, and engineering (and mathematics)\" 54, \"Wikipedia (meta)\" 5,  \"Generic\" 15. I don't think that's a helpful distribution. In particular \"Geographical\" doesn't seem useful here - maybe merge with History and society? And the Science one is way too big, we'll be hitting Lua errors quickly. So I would split that. Maybe Generic and meta can merge also. 6 pages with around 20 proposals on each would be perfect. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:58, 7 April 2016 (UTC)\n*****::: What is the purpose of that sorting, exactly ? Does it really matter that it's balanced ? We probably will have a perpetual unbalanced proposal proportion because of shifting in focus of editors, needs, and because ''one proposal can call other in the same field''. If we seek balance we will constantly have to reorganize the property proposals. What we need is the most is readability and meaningful and useful organization. \n*****::: One of the feature I would <u>actually</u> want is not balance who seems purposeless by itself, except if there is an overflow of proposals that challenges mediawiki or this leads to a mess, but alignment of the type of datas to the sorting of the proposal. One could think of \"domain alignment\" : if a proposal is linked to a class of datas, for example \"date of birth\" links to human (but could be generalized), then the place where we put another property related to \"human\" should be the same. Because we don't really want to search all other the place the best place where to put properties. So we should have a crystal clear sorting process with readable rules. The problem is the same before or after the proposal : how do we find a property after the creation ? What are the entry points ? It would be really great if we could find a rule that applies in both cases. Why ? Because, just stay focused with the property proposals, it would avoid request for a duplicate. In short : we should think hard on how to link proposals to projects and to classes of items, in a \"not so messy\" way. I created a point that was intended to be a global entry point a while ago, in the sense that when you search for something you would find it by reading it and find the classes, the projects, the proposals and so on starting from the page [[Help:Modelling]]. With a moderate success for know but maybe it's time to rethink again all together because it seems the problem is still not solved :) <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:53, 8 April 2016 (UTC) \n*****:::: [[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]]  - well I wasn't expecting it to be exactly and always balanced, but you are right that the balance does naturally shift over time, and sometimes quickly when a lot of new properties are needed in some area. I'm not quite sure if I understand what you are proposing though. Many properties have the {{Tld|Constraint:Type}} constraint implying that the property should only apply to items that are instances or subclasses of some principle class. Are you suggesting we group them according to that class they are being applied to? So there would be {{Q|5}} properties and then there's {{Q|386724}} and {{Q|2221906}} and {{Q|43229}} maybe. Is there a concrete short list of these that would cover most property proposals well? Or maybe the best approach is just to have some sort of monthly list of all proposals with pointers from relevant other lists (and wikiproject pages) as others seem to be suggesting here ??? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:38, 8 April 2016 (UTC)\n*****::::: {{Ping|ArthurPSmith}} I think that there is too many approaches already for (atually not really) sorting properties and that's finally a mess. The \"global list of properties\" fails for so many reasons that I don't think I have to detail. We have to rely on external tools that are starting to pile up for this to have a chance to work. The \"by domain of applications\" have a moderate success, mainly because this was a starting point but I think nobody is really totally satisfied with this. On the other hand regrouping by the classes of items the property applies is an approach that is omnipresent in the computing world. I'd like that for example we find a way to integrate initiative of mine like {{tl|property for this type}}\u00a0and the corresponding property. Then, as there is a set of properties that is appliable to a class of item, this is actually a natural way to sort properties as you note. Pulling we also have a natural way to sort the classes themselves : the class tree/hierarchy. I'd like that we use more those \"natural structure\" in our process. This would help to consistently develop the hierarchies, the classes themselves ... For example one stuff I think is not really good in our property proposal process is that it's not so easy, before proposing a property or reviewing it, is to see if there is a duplicate property that could be used. Mainly one our way to discover properties could be to create a proposal and wait for someone more involved to point us to a solution to our problem ... this is a massive loss of time because instead of searching for a solution, finding it, and add the statement, we have to wait the answers of someone to answer, and that can take days instead of minutes, at best, with the cost of entering a bureaucratic process. This is a massive failure of our organization. I really think that instead of tweaking the bureaucratic process, we should really best think of our global organization, in particular how to integrate better the different parts of the wikidata day to day work : creating projects, proposing properties, creating class hierarchies ... All this is actually too loosely coupled. We don't have working and consensual guidelines that could help us achieve that. <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 10:47, 9 April 2016 (UTC)\n\n:Do bear in mind that some editors are prepared to accuse other editors of \"hiding\" proposals, if they do not agree that the page on which the proposal was made is the correct one, even when the proposal gathered comments from other, uninvolved, editors, and remained visible for a period of months. <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 14:17, 22 March 2016 (UTC)\n::Perhaps the answer to that is to have properties proposed on e.g. monthly pages and pointers to them placed on various lists, e.g. the SSSI (England) ID I proposed could be linked to from pages relating to Authority control, environment, Places (and/or United Kingdom if we want that specific) and designations.

Because it's not that easy to find by yourself a property if you're a newcomer, or to have forgotten that a property existed, it's easy to miss something, so a good knowledge of Wikidata is crutial to take a good decision, avoid mistakes and gives good advices to property proposers.

This demonstrates that it's useful to have a way to enter such a dataset. On the other hand it doesn't demonstrate that it should be easy to enter such a dataset. \n\nWikidata could have a Gadget that enabled by default that restricts the data that can be entered. \nOne very useful restriction centers around \"instance of\".\nIf I want to add a family name of a person, Wikidata would help me a lot if it only shows concepts that have the property \"instance of\":\"family name\". In a case where Wikidata has no concept at the moment it might show me 10 different hits that have the same spelling as the family name but that are different concepts. It would help me lot if Wikidata would simply show me an empty list when there no concept with \"instance of\":\"family name\".\n\nI think it would help most people, because it would reduce the complexity of entering new data when Wikidata only shows you valid choices. However anybody who feels constraint by the feature could simply deactivate the gadget. Good UI can make simple tasks easy and complex tasks still possible. \n \nAs far as I know \"family name\" has no subclasses but when it comes to classes that have subclasses, items tagged with the subclasses should also be in the list.\n\n{{unsigned|ChristianKl}}\n\n*You might want to add a request to [[Phab:]].

However, I guess I'm a pretty strict and critical editor and I turn down most reference suggestions, as I don't find them reliable enough. And I did add quite a few domains to the [[Wikidata:Primary sources tool/URL blacklist|blacklist]]. But to do some reverse thinking: I would be totally willing to work on a whitelist of reliable websites that can serve as reliable sources for suggested claims and references. In my field of expertise (art and culture) I'd be able to produce these quite quickly, actually. I can also imagine that certain websites would be most useful for referencing specific types of claims (e.g. RKDartists would be a great source to feed references to birth dates and death dates, birth and death places of artists), so perhaps source whitelists per property could be an idea. [[User:Spinster|Spinster]] [[User talk:Spinster|\ud83d\udcac ]]  15:27, 13 June 2016 (UTC)\n\n== Issues ==\nI've been using Primary Sources for a while now, and I would like to outline some issues which I feel would make me use it more and make it more productive. \n\n=== Dataset ===\n* There is a number of exact duplicate statements displayed. There's no point to keep exact duplicates in the dataset or display them\n* There is a number of references referring to pages now dead, or servers unreachable, or redirecting to main page (sites that do that without issuing 404 should be launched on a rocket into the Sun but that's different issue :). These refs should be removed.\n* A lot of unreferenced statements are very hard to evaluate. Maybe StrepHit could help in that? \n* I think some of the people data are confusing people with the same name - e.g. {{Q|Q6687111}} and {{Q|Q11322}} - the latter is a movie actor and director, but the former is not, but Primary Sources thinks he is. Maybe it's problem with original data, but maybe some issue on the way. I wonder if there's an easy way to move the data to the right person. \n\n=== UI ===\n* The fact that each click causes full page reload makes working with it excruciatingly slow. If I have 20 statements on a big page, it 20 big page reloads. \n* Even more frustrating, sometimes after clicking on approve the reload does not return to the same place on the page, so I have to scroll down to locate where I was. \n* There is a lot of duplicate data items that differ only in references or qualifiers. There should be a way to join them without having to transfer references/qualifiers manually.\n* Some claims are improvement on an existing claim - e.g. more precise date. Right now I need to do several operations to replace one with another. It'd be nice if I could just replace them with one click. That especially true for properties that usually tend to have only one value - such as date of birth, gender, publication date, etc.\n* Sometimes the claim is right but needs to be amended (e.g. it claims year, but I actually have the source that has the date too).

What is the purpose of the proposal process? Why is it important for wikidata to have a relatively limited number of properties? Do we even have a consensus explanation for that? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:16, 27 May 2016 (UTC)\n:Consensus for property creators is [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/Restrict creation of properties to some users]]. [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/Clarifying the requirements for property creation]] is a followup. There is also the recently closed RFC at [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/Reforming the property creation process]]. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:41, 27 May 2016 (UTC)\n:From my point of view, the purpose of the process is so that we can ensure we have a decent chance at not fragmenting our own ontology. In the olden days, there was no restriction on who could create a property, and so many properties were created (I have a pair at PFD right now from this time frame, I think). But many of them subsequently were deleted for any of a number of reasons: poor rationale for existence, bad documentation, duplication (in both a literally \"duplicates\" POV and a less literally \"subproperty\" POV), and so forth. This is valuable, as it allows us to manage our ontology sanely. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:45, 27 May 2016 (UTC)\n::I don't actually find it to be that sane. The closest analogy I can think of would be restricting creation of templates on Wikipedia. If we want better schema, better properties, we need to allow more people to gain direct experience making and refining them. Currently properties have deliberative processes for creation and deletion, but neither process provides much space for what makes wikis useful, such as openness, ease-of-use, responsiveness, experimentation, fast iteration, etc. There is no practical equivalent to a sandbox for properties. Even experimenting with items on Wikidata is awkward. Coming from Freebase (which I realize is not that well-regarded by many on Wikidata), one thing I appreciated there was the concept of a [http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/Commons Commons] which designates mature, approved schema, while ordinary users with the motivation to do so were still free to develop and familiarize themselves with property development in a separate \"[http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/Base base]\" which they can work on by themselves, or can open up to whatever degree and style of collaboration they choose. Good schema and well-defined properties could then be promoted with strong consensus to the Commons, sometimes already with significant quality data to expose. This does presume a system capable of handling a certain scale of entities, but the goal is for Wikidata to be able to handle citations for the other Wikimedia projects, then the community will eventually need to let go of the notion that it will be able manage items and properties the same way that other wikis handle content pages. Perhaps that won't work here, but I think liberalizing property creation should still be something worth discussing. [[User:Dancter|Dancter]] ([[User talk:Dancter|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:24, 27 May 2016 (UTC)\n:: [[User:Izno|Izno]] thanks for the links, that does help give some background. However your explanation regarding fragmentation of the ontology is clearer than anything I could find in the old discussion, so thanks even more for that. Rereading all this, I think the main points are:\n::* We want multiple people to think about a new property before it is created, to catch possible issues like duplication of existing properties, wrong data types, source data that won't work with wikidata for some reason (eg. license issues), or just general problems in the definition or logic of the proposal. Wikidata's aim is structured data, so properties that encourage that are good, properties that allow basically unstructured strings are not. Creating and then deleting lots of new properties that have problems of this sort results in wasted work (and there was some experience with this in the early days); creating and not deleting them so that these properties become widely used makes wikidata less useful through inconsistencies and illogic or possibly even legal ramifications (on license issues).\n::* These considerations led to the proposal process, which encourages discussion before creation, and the property creators as a special user group. However there has never been full agreement on what constitutes consensus: some argued that no support or opposition after a period of time indicates a negative consensus, others interpret it as positive or undecided. When there is discussion with both supporting and opposing comments there is no fixed pattern for a property creator to decide what the consensus is, it is basically up to the one who takes it on to make the decision as best they can. One good opposing comment, or even a neutral comment questioning the logic of a proposal, might be sufficient to give pause in property creation until it can be resolved, even if there are many voices in support. On the other hand, the existence of one or several opposing comments doesn't necessarily mean a property shouldn't be created, the property creator needs to assess the arguments and give everything due weight. This is a subjective process and others might argue differently. We trust property creators to be responsible in their use of their authority. Abuse should trigger a referral to administrators.\n::* The guidelines for property creators at [[WD:PTC]] have evolved to reflect RFC's like this one on how those with that right should act. Most of the guidelines say \"should\" rather than \"must\". I would interpret \"should\" as allowing for exceptions, while \"must\" does not. One of the \"should\" items concerns the time period for discussion. If a property creator really feels consensus has been clearly reached with multiple independent people contributing to that consensus, I would argue that is more important than the time period allowed. In general the important thing is the first point above: multiple people thinking about the ramifications of a new property. One can find many examples where properties have been created with very little of that evident, but that's the ideal.\n:: does this seem about right? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:57, 27 May 2016 (UTC)\n:::Yes Arthur that sounds about right. Let me also say here that I for one have been VERY grateful for all of the documentation that has recently occurred in the whole area of property creation and I am finding it a bit easier to understand as a process. That said, I am also really sad to see the nature of some of the recent disputes around property creation. I also hate to see words like \"must\" in a volunteer-run project, though perhaps we are moving in that general direction. :( [[User:Jane023|Jane023]] ([[User talk:Jane023|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 07:07, 28 May 2016 (UTC)\n::: Indeed, points one and two are approximately the case. Regarding your third point: We use RFCs because of the international part of this project, where edits made due to some discussion on [[WD:PC]] or elsewhere may not have consensus due to the other language opinions. Indeed, \"should\" allows for some exceptions and \"must\" allows for lesser, if any (what does {{Q|Q4656211}} mean, if anything, on this wiki? this process?). I also agree with \"multiple independent people being more important\" but caveated as something closer to \"multiple independent points of view\". --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 12:31, 28 May 2016 (UTC)\n\nFor reference, [[Wikidata:Property creators]], which is a Wikidata policy, currently says: \"The period before a property can be created should be no less than one week.\" This time period seems to work well. --[[User:Srittau|Srittau]] ([[User talk:Srittau|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:05, 29 May 2016 (UTC)\n:One week is probably far to short if we have to consider every reason people disliked how P2860 was created. It is maybe enough for a reasonable amount of users to find the proposal, but that is probably the only issue we solve during only 7 days. But having a longer period would make the process even more frustrating than it is today. -- [[User:Innocent bystander|Innocent bystander]] ([[User talk:Innocent bystander|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:20, 29 May 2016 (UTC)\n::Most proposals don't need 7 days of intense discussion, but some do need longer (see for example the discussions about how best to store what area a map of a given object needs to be displayed - zoom level, bounding box, maximum edge-edge distance, diameter, northern-etc-most point, etc), which is why I explicitly am not proposing a maximum length of discussion. If consensus is clear at the end of the minimum period (48 hours is my first preference) then it can be created/not created as appropriate, if consensus is unclear and/or discussion still ongoing then it can remain open. I agree that properties requests dragging on excessively long (not infrequently months) is frustrating, but that is a very different issue to the one this RfC seeks to address. Most of the reasons people dislike the creation of P2860 are because it was created without opportunity for input from those not attending the conference and things that could have been quickly and easily identified ''and resolved'' prior to creation were overlooked but still need addressing (which is less easy now). Indeed had the property not been speedily created I suspect that it would have been done so with clear support in less than a week.

This is problematic because oftentimes, said editors had little active participation in our community and their votes were often \"drive-by\" votes. This is not the first time this has happened, though I will avoid naming specific examples out of respect to the candidates (out of 7 requests I know of where this happened, only 2 of them passed).\n\nParticipation in our community is especially important for RfP votes because we have rights such as property creator that are unique to us (and administrators are tasked with exercising and assigning that right). Currently, while bureaucrats have ''some'' discretion, any registered user can vote, sometimes making it hard to ensure that requests for permissions reflect the will of our community and not drive-by voters from outside, and it is often subjective whether a given vote should stand; hence I believe concrete requirements are needed. To this end, I am proposing to introduce an eligibility requirement for voters. This would ''not'' affect eligibility to ''request'' a user right - anyone can still request any local user right, except for the usual restrictions pertaining to CheckUser and Oversight.\n\n==Eligibility options==\nThese options are mutually exclusive, and therefore, it is highly encouraged to support at most one of them.\n===Option 0: Status quo===\nThe current requirement: any registered user can vote.\n# Restrictions are unnecessary.

This is less so for permissions like rollback which (in my experience) differ little in use and culture between projects but it is far simpler to define the suffrage for all RFPs together rather than individually and I see significantly less downside to restricting new users from commenting on rollback permission requests than I do from not erecting a barrier to canvassing.

But as with Wikipedia, this creates problems with the reliability of our information - how do we know that a modification of a piece of data changes it from right to wrong, or vice versa? Much of the information here currently lacks references. For some easily-derived data, this isn't a problem (such as Commons category and other project-internal information). But to ensure the quality of our database as a whole, we need to ensure that consumers of our data can verify the correctness of our information. [[Help:Sources]] currently mentions sourcing of information, but does not specify ''what'' sources are acceptable, nor any special implications for living people. There currently exists a [[Wikidata:Verifiability]] page, but it does not address all the issues here.\n\nThis has two important implications.\n\n=== [[Wikidata:Living people]] ===\nThis is a foundation-level principle.<ref>[[:wmf:Resolution:Media about living people|Foundation resolution]]</ref> It is of utmost importance that the information we store about living people be verifiable. But we need to define what \"verifiable\" means in the context of our project. This was a concern brought up in the English Wikipedia RfC on using phase 2 of Wikidata,<ref>[[:w:en:Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Wikidata Phase 2|English Wikipedia RfC]]</ref> and almost surely has been such an issue elsewhere as well.\n\n=== [[Wikidata:Notability]] ===\nPoint 2 has been the subject of dispute because it relies on the currently ill-defined notion of verifiability. \n\n==Information which needs referencing==\nIt is impossible to enumerate every type of information we can store. However, a general agreement is needed. Indicate below whether you support or oppose it. These would replace the existing \"Verifiability in practice\" section at [[Wikidata:Verifiability]].\n===General guideline===\nInformation on Wikidata must be ''verifiable'' - reasonable consumers of our data should be convinced that it is correct.\n\nWith the following exceptions, all information (particularly claims) must have at least one reliable source. The exceptions are:\n#Project-internal information such as template-related data and project pages\n#The exceptions at [[Help:Sources#When to source a statement]], except that the first of those does not apply to information regarding living people\n#Anything that can be derived from already-referenced information by simple mathematical calculations, such that any reasonable consumer of the data could immediately verify them\n\nThe referencing of material should be done as currently described by [[Wikidata:Verifiability]] and [[Help:Sources]].\n====Votes 2.1 ====\n*{{support}} - though I would suggest the two additional exceptions here (and any further ones, for example specific properties as in the item just below) should just be added to [[Help:Sources#When_to_source_a_statement]].

At the same time, I am in the short term (2-5+ years) willing to tolerate unverified claims. Everyone has to tolerate this, because at this point the priority in Wikimedia projects is ease of contribution and not increasing quality. I will not say that preparing for a future without references is a good thing. Claims without references should be solicited with less enthusiasm as compared to claims with references.\n:Even though I support having a rule that content must have references, I oppose the enforcement of this rule for the next few years. If casual users add content without verification, then they should be thanked and asked to consider providing references. As users get more engaged, and as the community evaluates larger projects, then the need to demand compliance to verification needs increases. For any new large scale well-funded projects, having references should be required.\n:Personally, I am comfortable having rules which say one thing and community practices which permit other things. For now it is enough for me if people come to learn the rule and what is expected, and at some later time, 2-5 years from now, I would support stronger enforcement. As Andy describes, I would not like to see near-future mass removal of data following the passing of this rule. I would like to see contributors increasing encouraged to provide verification.

Perhaps the first step in the right direction has been the \"segregation\" of identifiers. One doesn't sensibly require verification of an identifier statement, one asks that it (the identification) is carried out properly. For an image statement, one can see a similar issue. Starting at the other end, I would say that unverified dates of birth/death, and unverified statements of family relationships, are two areas that should raise red flags. These are massive things to source; and they are well worth sourcing. But there is a clear need to do such biographical cleanup sensibly. Which is a small corner of the general issue. [[User:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews]] ([[User talk:Charles Matthews|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:33, 7 July 2016 (UTC)\n* {{O}} I totally support the idea in theory, but we just don't have the tools to do this yet. You can't even easily add references by hand, much less update deadlinks and so forth. It would be ridiculous to make this a policy unless you also say there will be no sanctions for ignoring the policy until we have the tools. Intention is one thing, tooling is another. Also, as many others have pointed out, many statements are self-referencing (such as images or authority control properties) which would mean an overkill of references.

While the issue is an important one and the proposal well-intentioned, a pre-moderation strategy (prevent/remove edits whose source is missing or hasn't been reviewed) would effectively stop Wikidata's growth.

First - on making \"Help\" pages policy; I'm not sure what the standards ought to be here, but I certainly don't mind having all the exceptions listed on some other page; as I suggested in my vote I think the rules for sourcing should be together in one place wherever that is. Second - I was assuming this would be a policy applied only going forward, so new data added should meet sourcing standards. I do not support removal of unsourced data in wikidata just because it lacks a source, and if that is what is really being proposed here then I am also opposed to this change. I do agree a \"citation needed\" flag attachable to any unsourced statement would be helpful. Note that the Help page mentioned does exclude external id's from the sourcing requirements.

That the claim is deleted if there is no reference? Or that a nice wikidata user makes an automated list of claims missing references? I suppose with living people there are issues with privacy and the like, e.g., linkage to criminal behavior. {{P|551}}, {{p|1329}}, {{P|140}}, {{p|172}} and {{p|1399}} would be the problematic properties as I see it.

They don't seem to be well suited for the reality of Wikidata. In some cases the language of a proposal is ok, but I can't imagine any positive action it might be used for. I suggest to redo the discussion from scratch with a clearer \"use case\" (objectives we want to achieve) and a way to monitor how well we're doing against the goal. [[User:Nemo_bis|Nemo]] 09:59, 7 July 2016 (UTC)\n\n* To me, one of the problems with this RFC is that is does not specify in enough detail how sourcing is expected to be implemented, who/what will check things, etc. Detailed information on how the RFC handles the various used of References on statements is required. Keep in mind that Wikidata has a granular system for statements, and various mechanisms of giving a Reference, not all of which seem to be allowed by this RFC, but it is very unclear in what is and is not allowed. Moreover, as others have indicated, no mechanism is in place to challenge decisions based on this RFC, or how to correct situations. I would also welcome to get an idea of how urgent a solution is to the problems that are behind this RFC.

A tool allowing to mark, and thus easily find and unsufficiently sourced data, would be much more useful. Specifically, a tool allowing to search for insufficiently sourced specific properties, with wp import, could allow to try and search info inside relevant wp, methodically... \n\n* To me a background colouring system (allowing to choose the colour, for adaptability to various colour-blindness), that would make obvious that a data has \"no source\", or \"wp-only source\", could really help, looking for specific data sourcing\u2026 --[[User:Hsarrazin|Hsarrazin]] ([[User talk:Hsarrazin|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 12:19, 7 July 2016 (UTC)\n\n* I like the fact that this RfC is attempting to address many issues that are important; however, the overarching approaches seem to either re-invent existing policies/functions, take an extreme approach, or focus on deletion and blocking over constructive \"citation needed\" and teachable engagement to develop editors into better editors.

To achieve high quality, it is important to define first what data quality is on this knowledge base.\nAs part of the Web and Internet Science group at the University of Southampton, I am currently a guest of Wikimedia Deutschland, where I am carrying out a study about data quality on Wikidata.\nMy research group aims to prepare a data-quality framework to describe the quality issues affecting Wikidata, and ultimately to perform a large-scale assessment of it.\nWikidata community members are responsible for the creation and maintenance of this knowledge base, and are likely to be aware of the quality issues that are most important for Wikidata. With this request for comment, we would like to leverage the user contribution to:\n* Help describe and categorise Wikidata quality issues;\n* Add further quality aspects (dimensions) to those that have already been identified, or to improve the focus of dimensions that have already been selected.\nWe ask users to provide comments and advice about the data-quality dimensions we have already identified. We will be glad to discuss about each data quality aspect why it is important, what are practical examples of it, and whether there are other aspects that may be of interest. The discussion will be open until 4 September 2016.\n\nData quality is usually defined as fitness for use, which means that it is evaluated from the point of view of the data consumer and with respect to a task at hand. Nevertheless, the specifics of collaboratively created knowledge bases require us to look at data quality under a different perspective. Following Lukanyenko et al., 2014<ref>Lukyanenko, R., Parsons, J., & Wiersma, Y. F. (2014). The IQ of the crowd: understanding and improving information quality in structured user-generated content. ''Information Systems Research, 25''(4), 669-689.</ref>, we define data quality as \u201cthe extent to which stored information represents the phenomena of interest to data consumers (and project sponsors), as perceived by information contributors\u201d.\nData quality dimensions are the aspects of quality that can be considered while assessing a knowledge base. In the first step of our research, we have selected a number of dimensions from the scientific literature. The main sources for our selection have been articles of Wang & Strong, 1996<ref>Wang, R. Y., & Strong, D. M. (1996). Beyond accuracy: What data quality means to data consumers. ''Journal of management information systems, 12''(4), 5-33.</ref> and Zaveri et al., 2015<ref>Zaveri, A., Rula, A., Maurino, A., Pietrobon, R., Lehmann, J., & Auer, S. (2015). Quality assessment for Linked Data: A survey. ''Semantic Web, 7''(1), 63-93</ref>. We decided to include or discard dimensions on the basis of their relevance to the peculiarities of Wikidata and of their possible application for a large-scale quality evaluation.\nHowever, Wikidata is a community project: its active community is its strength and the main responsible for its maintenance and growth. Therefore, as mentioned above, we would like to refine the quality dimensions selected with the help of the community. We publish them here, inviting everyone to contribute by commenting or providing any advice, to discuss the choices made, improve the definitions created, and develop appropriate metrics for the relevant dimensions. \nYou will probably notice the repeated use of words such as \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201cappropriate\u201d. What these words actually refer to depends on context. The help of the Wikidata community will allow us to better define them.\nAny contribution by community members will be appreciated; please feel free to ask any questions if you find anything unclear.\n\nMany thanks,\n--[[User:Alessandro Piscopo|Alessandro Piscopo]] ([[User talk:Alessandro Piscopo|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]])\n\n== Intrinsic dimensions ==\nIntrinsic dimensions refer to characteristics of data that can be evaluated independently from the context. The ones we included are accuracy, objectivity, reputation, and consistency.\n\n=== Accuracy === \nThe extent to which data are accepted as true and free of error. \n* '''Description and examples''': A statement is said to be accurate if it is in agreement with what stated in its reference. In case a reference is not available or not needed, a statement is considered as accurate if it correctly represent a fact in the real world. For example, Milan\u2019s population as of 31 December 2015 is stated as 1,359,905 ([[Q490]]). This value corresponds to that in the specified source, therefore it can be considered as accurate. \n\n=== Objectivity ===\nThe extent to which data are free of bias and impartial.\n* '''Description and examples''': Labels, descriptions, and aliases should not be derogatory and as much as possible not express a partial point of view. In case of debated facts, statements accounting for different positions should be given.\n\n=== Reputation ===\nThe extent to which sources specified for data are trustworthy.\n* '''Description and examples''': References should be sources recognised as impartial and authoritative. E.g. for demographic data, census governmental sources are considered as trustworthy, whereas poorly documented websites are not. Sources must be easily verifiable as well: the referenced piece of information should be easy to find within the source, e.g. a human or a machine should be possibly able to retrieve it directly on the page linked. In the above case of Milan ([[Q490]]), for instance, after clicking on the source link, users must click on another link to open a PDF file where the data is found.\n\n=== Consistency ===\nThe extent to which data comply with or concur to form a consistent knowledge representation.\n* '''Description and examples''': Class membership relations must be clear and consistent. Misuse of subclass of and instance of relations is among the causes of errors related to this dimension.\n\n== Contextual dimensions ==\nContextual dimensions refer to the extent to which data are fit for the task at hand. They may be therefore hard to measure without clear use cases defined and may need to identify an optimal standard. The contextual dimensions we included are ''timeliness'' and ''completeness''.\n\n=== Timeliness ===\nThe extent to which data are sufficiently up to date.\n* '''Description and examples''': This dimension refers to how frequently is data updated, whether its validity time is specified (start and end date), and its currency, i.e. whether it represents a present state of things in the real world.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nCompleteness describes whether data have sufficient breadth, depth, and scope. Following the literature, we identify:\n\n==== Schema completeness ====\nThe extent to which a sufficient number of classes and properties is present.\n* '''Description and examples''': Classes and properties should allow to represent concepts and state facts with a certain degree of precision, but they cannot be in a number such as to be a burden for users when adding new content.\n\n==== Item completeness ====\nThe extent to which the instances of a class (i.e. Items) include all the properties/statements relevant to that class.\n* '''Description and examples''': All instances of the class \"human\" ([[Q5]]) must have the \"date of birth\" ([[Property:P569]]) property.\n\n==== Population completeness ====\nThe extent to which all the possible instances of a class are represented.\n* '''Description and examples''': All Italian towns should be present, given the class \"comune of Italy\" ([[Q747074]]).\n\n== Representational dimensions ==\n\n=== Interpretability ===\nThe extent to which data can be interpreted by machines without ambiguity.\n* '''Description and examples''': The value of a property must be expressed in an appropriate format and with appropriate units, enriched with ranks, and described using external vocabularies. Classes and properties should be linked to external KBs, by using the \"equivalent class\" ([[Property:P1709]]) property or the \"equivalent property\" ([[Property:P1628]]) property.\n\n=== Ease of understanding ===\nThe extent to which data can be comprehended without ambiguity by humans.\n* '''Description and examples''': Labels and descriptions should be provided in an appropriate number of languages.\n\n== Accessibility ==\n\n=== Interlinking ===\nThe extent to which data are sufficiently interlinked to other resources, either within or without Wikimedia.\n* '''Description and examples''': Items should be linked to equivalent entities in other knowledge bases; Items should have an appropriate number of links to other Wikimedia projects.\n\n== Other dimensions ==\nThe following are quality dimensions that were in the framework we mainly relied upon (Wang & Strong, 1996<ref>Wang, R. Y., & Strong, D. M. (1996). Beyond accuracy: What data quality means to data consumers. ''Journal of management information systems, 12''(4), 5-33.</ref>), but which were not included in our selection. The definitions are from Wang & Strong (1996).\n\n;Believability\nThe extent to which data are accepted or regarded as true, real, and credible.\n\n;Relevancy\nThe extent to which data are applicable and helpful for the task at hand.\n\n;Value-added\nThe extent to which data are beneficial and provide advantages from their use.\n\n;Appropriate amount of data\nThe extent to which the quantity or volume of available data is appropriate.\n\n;Representational consistency\nThe extent to which data are always presented in the same format and are compatible with previous data.\n\n;Concise representation\nThe extent to which data are compactly represented without being overwhelmed.\n\n;Accessibility\nThe extent to which data are available or easily and quickly retrievable.\n\n;Access security\nThe extent to which access to data can be restricted and hence kept secure.\n\n== Comments and questions ==\nThis space is reserved to comments and questions. Please try to address the following questions in your comments:\n==== Do you think that the above mentioned quality dimensions are sufficient to describe the characteristics of the data in Wikidata and the types of possible quality issues? ====\n: It seems to me this is an excellent way to think about and assess quality issues. However, I don't believe, and I'm guessing the wikidata community won't feel, that all these are of equal importance, or even necessarily desirable as goals. Completeness for example - we have discussed notability requirements before; the main reason to be concerned about notability is that having a huge number of less-frequented items invites neglect and abuse. So the degree of completeness is dependent on the number of eyeballs we have available (enhanced by whatever automated tools we have) to review things. So I'm guessing the approach would be more to figure out along which dimensions we are doing well, which ones we need to improve, and which ones we can neglect (at least for now)? This does seem like a good list of conceptual measures for us. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:45, 12 August 2016 (UTC)\n:: I'm not sure that using notability as a strategy for limiting the amount of data given limited eyeballs is a good strategy. In the area of family history for example there are people who care about doing high quality research on the history of their family. ::Allowing those kinds of people into Wikidata would be valuable for growing the amount of eyeballs. \n::Recently I looked at the family of {{Q|Q160202}}. After a bid of searching I found that his father-in-law owned {{Q|Q26252088}} at the Wiki for the History of the city of Vienna (the Wiki is a project of the city of Vienna). Knowing that the father-in-law was dead at the time of the marriage of {{Q|Q160202}} is interesting information that wasn't available in the biographies of {{Q|Q160202}} that I read but only at the Vienna Wiki.\n::Being able to connect that information was interesting but the fact that the connection exist couldn't be seen beforehand. The same is true for many people that lived in the 19th century or earlier. Their significance can only be found by gathering data from multiple sources.\n::The fact that Wikidata allows me to link the father to the pharmacy in which he worked also allows information to be documented that couldn't have been documented in ancestry databases like http://www.ancestry.com/ that are also unfortunately closed information.\n::I think that generally information for which real sources exist and that isn't simply personal opinion should be welcomed at Wikidata. I think it would also be very good to invite communities like the family history community into Wikidata to grow the amounts of eyeballs that we have. With editing family history the people are also interested in the locations where their family members acted and therefore likely won't only edit items of people in their family.[[User:ChristianKl|ChristianKl]] ([[User talk:ChristianKl|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:23, 13 August 2016 (UTC)\n::: I think that what \"deserves\" to be included in Wikidata, i.e. the notability policy and consequently the concept of completeness, defines the aim itself of the project. This is a topic much greater than this discussion, I believe. For this reason, it could be useful to define a level of completeness that the community thinks it fits the possible uses of Wikidata (well, also this point could be debated a lot, but perhaps it is simpler). \n::: With regard to [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]]'s remarks about the approach to be followed, this is actually the goal of this RfC and of our research. We would like to understand what quality means to Wikidata, which dimensions are important, and how we define them in order to successively build some metrics to measure the issues deemed as the most relevant by the community. --[[User:Alessandro Piscopo|Alessandro Piscopo]] ([[User talk:Alessandro Piscopo|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 10:29, 16 August 2016 (UTC)\n:::: We already have a tool to asses completeness of a dataset. It's way more easy to define the boundaries of subdatasets of wikidata and to work on their completeness than to define notability in general, evaluate how complete is wikidata as a whole wrt. the whole potential entities that could exists and the totals potential data there is for each, which is not the same considering not only the type of entities themselves but also beetween entities of the same kind - take a politician career, it can have a very different number of lines considering the politician. This is an holistic approach, but what about a \"part to whole\" approach using https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tools/External_tools/fr#COOL-WD:_A_Completeness_Tool_for_Wikidata that would evaluate the completeness of subsets of wikidata, the proportion of items covering of such specific complete datasets wrt. a defined criteria wrt the whole wikidata dataset, and as such evaluate some kind of quality score of one subset of wikidata. This seem way more practical to have a divide and conquer strategy than to try to take the problem holistically. And this would not require once and for all to have binary criterias such has \"OK to go in, not OK\". By definition of \"non notable\" entities on other wikimedia projects, they should have a poor covering score and we hardly would be able to prove they are complete without external references, could not we ? <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 13:00, 16 August 2016 (UTC) \n:::: Another completeness approach, as wikidata aims to be a secondary database, is a relative one : how much wikidata is complete on some dataset wrt. another one ? <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 13:00, 16 August 2016 (UTC)\n\n::::: Hi, thanks for letting me know COOL-WD, I didn't know it and it is a very interesting tool. I have still not very clear how it works, I will read the paper they published about it to understand it a bit more. However, it covers only one of the three aspects of completeness in this framework draft, i.e. 'item completeness'. It is an aspect that can be approached by Item and does not need to be evaluated on Wikidata as a whole. The results obtained with COOL-WD could be compared to other approaches, in other to choose the one that offers the best performance. Furthermore, COOL-WD employs user-generated completeness statements: it is an interesting features, which nicely fits with the collaborative nature of Wikidata, but in order to be used on a large scale it would be to be implemented in the system.\n::::: The other completeness approach you suggest would be related to 'population completeness'. This is I think the type of completeness most related to the notability policy. Regarding to your idea to use external datasets, it would be actually good to use it to assess how complete Wikidata is on determined domains, e.g. biology; the problem is: how do we define golden standard external datasets?--[[User:Alessandro Piscopo|Alessandro Piscopo]] ([[User talk:Alessandro Piscopo|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:13, 17 August 2016 (UTC)\n:::::: Part of the anwser is imho here. https://blog.wikimedia.de/2013/06/04/on-truths-and-lies/ . With wikidata, we'll have tool to judge datasets : how consistent are they internally, how consistent are datasets wrt. each overs ? My guess is that good datasets will have more internal consistency for example.\n:::::: Also 'population completeness' can't be achived if our model is not complete enough to import some dataset - if we lack an essential property for example.

If the data can't be seconded, then it's condemned to stay with a poor public quality score. Then we could keep the data and spare the effort to delete it which is time consuming and conflict prone - this can destroy a community - and providing people with high standards with quality information and let them have a personal discipline \"I ignore information with a score no higher than x\". <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 13:24, 16 August 2016 (UTC)\n: I'm in favor. It might not even need personal discipline. The software could automatically hide information below a certain quality score for users that only want to see information over the score.

My experience is that the lua code and the WD data is connected. Maybe I could say that the lua module shows the quality of the data, by crashing, showing nonsense or showing nothing. There is another lua module using the same data as my module and I have seen that sometimes the other module wants the data in a way that is different from the way my module want them. Another point is maybe \"Representational consistency\". I have build some flexibility into the lua modules so that the module could work with different ways (e.g. different qualifier) and items an information is stored. I\u00b4m afraid this will be a big problem for the future, maybe we will have a lot of work to rearrange the data in a more consistent way. Another problem is that for maintaining data it is necessary to find all those items that should be maintained with a sparql-query. But it is not possible to get 100% of all items belonging to a topic. Therefore there will always be some errors in the code. I would say that we need to have ways to show to users that there is an error and help is needed. A crashing lua module, for example, is no good way to do that. For companies there is something like \"ISO 9000\" (quality management systems standards), I would say that there should be something similar for databases and maybe Wikidata could be a place to develop something like that. --[[User:Molarus|Molarus]] 10:11, 1 September 2016 (UTC)\n\n==== Would you add any other dimensions to the ones already listed? ====\n\nUniqueness - Is there more than one definiton or representation for the same information.

But many of these soft constraints, when they are marked as mandatory, are only acting as community-driven patches to try to solve Wikidata structural deficiencies. For example, duplicating information is one of the worst things to do in a database, and this is possible, even demanded, in Wikidata on properties with the {{tl|Constraint:Symmetric}}. Wikidata should ensure (but is currently not ensuring) by itself the accomplishment of this constraint by automatically adding (B.propertyX := A) every time that (A.propertyX := B) is defined by a user, where propertyX is a property with a mandatory Constraint:Symmetric. The same with {{tl|Constraint:Inverse}}, mutatis mutandis. These soft constraints are currently not implemented as a part of the Wikidata interface, so well-known inconsistencies [[Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/Mandatory constraints/Violations|grow dangerously over time]] and the Wikidata community cannot avoid this data degradation by now.\n::Apart from linked constraints:\n::* we shouldn't let users include URLs that point to non-existent or non-accesible resources (for example, to pages that return a 404 error) as values for properties like {{P|2002}} (external identifier) or {{P|856}} (URL);\n::* we should use unit conversion to avoid inconsistencies as it would let us define range limits not only focused on numbers, but also on what these numbers mean with their units;\n::* we should limit quantity properties to integers when needed (see [[phab:T112247]]);\n::* we should only create couples of equal items on certain properties ({{Q|Q7810}} can be the {{P|26}} of {{Q|Q7828}}, and {{Q|Q76}} can be the {{P|26}} of {{Q|Q13133}}, but {{Q|Q7810}} cannot be the {{P|26}} of {{Q|Q13133}} as both are instances of different items);\n::* we should avoid that an item A can be a value for two incompatible or redundant properties on an item B (for example, {{Q|Q19943}} should not be marked as {{P|22}} of {{Q|Q191045}} and as {{P|1038}} of {{Q|Q191045}} at the same time);\n::* we could force users to define properties {{P|31}} or {{P|279}} for any new item.\n::Only some examples that come to mind. --<span style=\"font-size:95%;\">[[User:Abi\u00e1n|abi]][[User talk:Abi\u00e1n|\u00e1n]]</span> 12:27, 16 August 2016 (UTC)\n\n::: My opinion is that different constraints could be used to find different types of issues.

With regard to the duplication of information, it would be a conciseness issues, but I don't think that the examples you made are really problems for Wikidata: unless we want to incorporate more sofisticated reasoning capabilities, duplicating information in the fashion of (B.propertyX := A) and (A.propertyX := B) is necessary to answer queries like \"give all the objects for B.propertyX := A\".\n::: As for your other points: I think it would be more in line with the spirit of Wikidata to avoid to force users to enter this or that value.

Your data quality guideline however doesn't say anything about contrasting pieces of information when speaking about accuracy or reputation.\n:::: I think data end users care about data that matches reality. If a government of an African country releases statistics that make that government look good and an independent authoritative body that hasn't a conflict of interest and has a reputation for accurate data has different data, I don't think it should be Wikidata policy to weight the numbers of the African country has having a better reputation as your data quality document suggests. You standards claim that the most authoritative source says that the Armenian genocide didn't happen given that it didn't happen in the offical numbers that the government of the territory presents offers.\n:::: I see no reason why the data quality document should suggest that government data is impartial. If you want to point to an example of impartial information than point to peer reviewed academic numbers. \n:::: Listing government data on Wikidata makes sense but for reasons that aren't that the data is impartial. \n:::: As far as defining whether data matches reality, if you want to have an operational definition I would use: \"Does a subject level expert consider the Wikidata number to be the best number available?\" That's the kind of number that a data customer of Wikidata wants to get. \n:::: Besides I'm not sure what \"A statement is said to be accurate if it is in agreement with what stated in its reference. \" means. Let's say I have a statement that Joe is born at 30.03.1855. The statement also has an authoritative reference from an authoritative biography stating that he is born in 1855.\n:::: Technically there's no disagreement between the two claims. They both agree. On the other hand the source doesn't accept \"30.03.1855\" as true, it makes no statment about whether or not that specific data is true. From a data quality perspective I however think agreement is not enough.\n:::: It becomes more interesting when the statement has a second low quality reference from someone's personal website saying that he's born at 30.03.1855. I think then it becomes more unclear about whether it's good data quality. I also don't think that your data quality document gives me a good answer. \n:::: Wikidata has the habit of requiring explicit statements about uncertainity of data.

The contribution of the community is important because we hope that the framework resulting from this discussion could be adopted by Wikidata in the future. In other words, any contribution is appreciated and valuable and you are free to suggest to include any dimension that was not included in the original draft. Thanks, --[[User:Alessandro Piscopo|Alessandro Piscopo]] ([[User talk:Alessandro Piscopo|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:58, 24 August 2016 (UTC)\n:::::::::::: It seems to me like the current point of \"accuracy\" mixes two concepts. We could call them \"veracity\" and \"accurate source representation\". I would see \"veracity\" to exist when Wikidata gives an answer that a domain expert would consider the best answer. Wikidata's answer could also be less specific than the answer of the domain expert without \"veracity\" suffering.\n:::::::::::: Apart from that it's also important that if Wikidata has a reference that reference backs up the claim for which it's cited. That's \"accurate source representation\". I just noticed a case where the primary source tool took a source who said \"Georg Forster (ca.1510 \u2014 12. November 1568)\" and translated it into the claim that Georg Forster was born in 1510 without the qualifier sourcing circumstances\" (P1480) with \"circa\". That violates my idea of \"accurate source representation\" and thus I filed a bug report at the tool under https://github.com/Wikidata/primarysources/issues/121.\n:::::::::::: There might be better names for the two, but both seem important to me. [[User:ChristianKl|ChristianKl]] ([[User talk:ChristianKl|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 12:29, 24 August 2016 (UTC)\n\n::::::::: Considering the university problem, I'd guess we would have to provide an actual model :) Things are mostly informal at this point. Then we could discuss discrepancies beetween models. <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 18:03, 23 August 2016 (UTC)\n\n==== General remarks ====\n* I have to say that if the intention is really good, the process of this RfC is not really efficient. In order to say something about the above parameters we have to know the metrics used to assess each parameter and the calculation method of the metrics. For me it is useless to discuss about the possible use of these parameters if we don't know how to calculate/define them. If a interesting parameter is requiring a huge amount of accurate data, this is not interesting to assess it before we have a sufficient amount of data. So for each parameter we should have the metric scale and the calculation method. [[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:58, 18 August 2016 (UTC)\n*: This is epistemology. Does a theory comes from observation or does theory problem ? Metrics usually don't come out of thin air, but need a few thing to be sort out and we need to know what is actually important from Wikidata. A metrics that does not measure anything meaningful is pretty useless. In science, sometimes we can't know what to measure before we actually have a theory to describe it. Take light polarisation. This can come only from some degree of theory of what light is and don't come out of thin air. As long as we don't know what quality can be and in which direction we should dig, we likely wil fail to define good metrics. This step is essential, and there no way to foresee if it has to be efficient. <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 15:16, 19 August 2016 (UTC)\n::: So the whole RfC process is wrong: why this RfC selects already a list of parameters ? If the process you described was correctly done we shouldn't have two lists of parameters and a question asking to support the first list without providing the reasons of that choice. There is two ways to do thing: you put everything on the table and you start the selection from the beginning with the whole community or you come with a good selection of parameters and you show why you select them and how you plan to use them.\n::: So I ask me what is the purpose of this RfC: to support the selection of one specialist or to really discuss about what the community defines as good quality parameters and how it wants to track that parameters ? If the objective was the second one we shouldn't have a section ''Other dimensions'' and some general questions at the end of the list but an equal treatment of each parameter (description, advantage, difficulty to measure) and an approval section after each parameter section.\n::: Perhaps the subject is difficult and the specialist wants to save time and long discussions. No problems, specialists are there for that, but in that case we need explanations about why the selected parameters are good for WD and how they can be used. So I repeat my first remark: as the whole discussion about the selection of the parameters was skipped, can we have the advantages of the selected parameters, and for me the most important advantage is the ease of use. But to be able to assess that criterion I need to know how the selected parameters will be calculated. [[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:21, 22 August 2016 (UTC)\n:::: OK, then let's say this is a RfC in the sense \"request for comment\"  broader sense and that it's not mature enough for you to \"vote\" or something like that. Maybe a next version/attempt. As far as I know it's a decent way to get comments and we don't have any better place for deep discussion here. <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 06:29, 23 August 2016 (UTC)\n\n===What is the practical point of a framework===\nI have followed the discussions and as far as I am concerned, it is truly theoretical and consequently it is theoretical. It is fine that there is literature about data quality but it does not follow that this has a practical consequence. When you want a framework for data quality, I expect a framework that includes methods to improve that quality. I do not care for yet another round of definitions. \n\nI have said it before, I say it again, when content is the same in multiple sources CHANCES are that it is correct. When you spend time to annotate differences by suplying sources you improve quality. That is what I seek in a framework. \n\nWhen Wikidata is to support Wikimedia projects, it is important to consider what it is that makes the data useful in those projects. It has a priority over importing data from elsewhere. Given that Wikidata is used in over 280 Wikipedias, language support is of extreme importance. So far it is not even a KPI. \n\nIt is relevant to be able to link to other sources and it is fine and dandy that some people do. But that they can does not mean that it is important when the results are only available to them. Linking to other sources is relevant with an ID when we also seek to make a difference in this way. It is fine to say that a substance is known in a registry of substances cleared for medical use, it is wrong to say that they are a medicine. We do not have a framework to indicate that substances are probably as good as a placebo and many substances have that and negative side effects. How would a framework help?\n\nWe do not need a framework researched by students from whatever university (I mean no disrespect) what we need is a practical discussion on what practical ways there are to improve our quality. When measures fit a framework it becomes important because then we get that these measures interact and increase their effectiveness. We need practical improvements that start from where we are as a resource. Wikidata is immature and mature requirements are not what we can impose at this time. We can work towards improvements but that is it.

He's not WMDE employee of as far as I can see is payed by a Wikimedia grant. Academic work doesn't need to have direct practical implication. In this case publishing work about data quality that shows that Wikidata cares about data quality in a venue that people who care about open data read, makes it more likely that they consider Wikidata a serious project and donate their data to it. \n: The people who did their work on vandalism detection in Wikidata have it easier in academia when they can cite a definition of quality standards.\n: Nothing in this article prevents you from having a discussion about direct ways to improve Wikidata's usefulness for Wikipedia. But that's not the discussion about the definition of data quality, it's likely to be had elsewhere.\n: There are many ways to interact with Wikidata. Live and let live. \n: If you want to improve Wikipedia integration it might make more sense to focus your energies on the practical project of https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:List_generation_input [[User:ChristianKl|ChristianKl]] ([[User talk:ChristianKl|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:44, 31 August 2016 (UTC)\n:: Academic work does not need to have direct practical implications, but \u2013 I believe \u2013 it should always take them into account and aim at concrete effects on things. I would not even find it totally correct to ask the Wikidata community to discuss this draft, if I did not think that it could be one day adopted (even partially) by Wikidata or at least be directly beneficial to it. So yes, it will be good if the outcome of this work will be published, it will be better it this will bring someone to donate to Wikidata, and it will be even better if quality measures will be developed and then used, based on this framework. And by the way, no, I do not get any Wikimedia grant :) --[[User:Alessandro Piscopo|Alessandro Piscopo]] ([[User talk:Alessandro Piscopo|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 23:39, 2 September 2016 (UTC)\n\n===Completeness===\nHi Alessandro, thanks for the RfC and your valiant participation in the discussion.\n\nMany of the contributions to the discussion point to specific implementations that can help by finding errors easier - such as constraints on data values, or consistency rules. I think those are very important in order to keep control of the data set - but in the end, they are merely a proxy to measuring quality. They do not really capture your quality measures, such as \u2018accuracy\u2019 and \u2018completeness\u2019, etc.\n\nWhile these suggestions and implementations are very important, I would be extremely happy to see you stay focused on the quality dimensions you mention. Your definitions look sane and good. Personally, I would weight these dimensions - e.g. have accuracy very high, consistency rather low, etc. - but your selection looks already quite complete, and I am not sure I would drop anything, besides on the completeness dimension.\n\nFor schema completeness, I would argue that since Wikidata does not have a standard class system, maybe we should focus on the properties only.\n\nFor item completeness, I would argue that focusing on just the classes and see whether they have all relevant properties is insufficient. My suggestion would be to compare to the Wikipedia article and see whether the most important information about a given item that is mentioned in the article is actually covered. \n\nFor population completeness, again I would argue against relying solely on classes.\n\nAll of the three subdimensions of completeness I would actually consider maybe complementing or partially replacing with query completeness. Given relevant queries, can we express these queries and do we get all results we are expecting. This would cover your subdimensions, and is also motivated by Wikidata\u2019s arguably most important role, to support the Wikimedia projects. Query results are planned to be available for integration and exposure in the other Wikimedia projects at some point (the legendary Phase 3 of the Wikidata project), and such a query completeness would directly capture how realistic such a goal is.\n\nI am looking forward to see your suggestions on how to operationalize these quality dimensions and the concrete metrics and measurements you will suggest. I hope this helps, and again, thank you! \u2014[[User:Denny|Denny]] ([[User talk:Denny|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:47, 1 September 2016 (UTC)\n\n:: Hi [[User:Denny|Denny]], thanks for your suggestions! The completeness dimension is indeed that one that gave me more doubts (not that the others did not), due to its strong connection with the task at hand, which in my opinion requires to answer the question \"What is Wikidata for?\"\n\n::I agree that query completeness is a good approach; the authors of COOL-WD have already explored it, I would like to have a more careful look at it and think about how it can be improved.\n\n::I will start elaborating the metrics in the next days, taking into account the discussions had on this page. As soon as I will devise the most appropriate metrics for the dimensions chosen, I will again update the community again on our findings.

For example, I expect that for a complete item, almost every articles linked in a language version of wikip\u00e9dia (or the union of all versions) be very close - say, one or two statements away - of the items used in the corresponding Wikidata item or that uses it. Maybe a very simple proportion of such items that uses the item we want to know is complete union all the items used by it compared to the items of the sitelinks of the corresponding article could be a good heuristic to evaluate the completeness of an item wrt.

This is unnecessary and causes problems:\n\n* All people should already have a {{P|21}} property, so saving it like this is pointless.\n* Some people are non-binary, see for example {{Q|4755100}}. Andrea Gibson has the gender {{Q|Q48270}} and has a sister {{Q|26880311}}. However, the sister doesn't have any brothers or sisters, she only has one sibling, but this sibling cannot be added to her item because of the forced gender binary. ''There are more examples of non-binary people with siblings.''\n\n== Proposal ==\nThese problems can be solved by adding non-binary properties ''or'' by merging the existing gendered properties.

We therefore want to give users a simple way to edit these descriptions.\n\n== Motivation ==\n[[File:Description edit onboarding 1.png|140px|right]] [[File:Description edit onboarding 2.png|140px|right]]\nWe'd like to create more ways of [[mw:Reading/Readers_contributions|engaging with our readers]], especially ways in which casual readers can be encouraged to make contributions. Giving them the ability to edit these descriptions is a viable starting point to experiment with whether our readers can be converted to meaningful contributors. In addition, since the description is intended to be very short and limited to plain text, it can translate very nicely into a native mobile editing interface.\n\nIn addition, we're interested in reinforcing the idea in our readers' minds that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit. Part of the workflow of editing these descriptions will be an encouragement to edit additional portions of the article itself.\n\nPlease see '''[https://wikimedia.invisionapp.com/share/YK98ZVQGN#/screens this mockup]''' for a rough idea of the editing workflow.\n'''We would love to hear your general feedback and suggestions on the workflow.'''\n\n== Questions about filtering and/or protecting against vandalism ==\n\nWe understand that presenting this feature to all of our readers will expose the descriptions to possible vandalism, and we want to do all we can to minimize nonconstructive edits. Here are some possible ways this can be done:\n\n* For some of the worst forms of vandalism, the edits will be caught by the [[mw:Extension:AbuseFilter|AbuseFilter]] extension.\n* Should we limit the number of edits a user can make (e.g. 5?) without creating an account?\n* Should we hide descriptions entirely for certain types of articles, such as lists?\n* Would it be possible to integrate with [[meta:Objective_Revision_Evaluation_Service|ORES]] and preemptively obtain a \"score\" for the proposed edit, and approve/reject it before submitting it?\n* Would it be possible to take the Wikidata properties of the item in question, and see if the user mentions any of the properties in the description? (i.e. the more properties are mentioned in the description, the higher the score of the edit)\n\n'''What other methods (client- or server-side) exist for preventing vandalism?'''\n\n:At best users of the mobile application would have a simple way to create accounts with Google OpenID and Facebook Login and all edits people make would come from an real account. In the absence of a real account I would like a hash of \"phone ID + 'Wikidata'\" instead of seeing an IP address of the user. [[User:ChristianKl|ChristianKl]] ([[User talk:ChristianKl|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:09, 3 November 2016 (UTC)\n\n== Feedback for the user ==\n\n[[File:Description edit revert notification.png|140px|right]]\nAlthough the app itself currently does not support any moderation or administration features, the editing experience for the user will not be totally \"blind\", meaning that the user will receive some form of notification if their edit is reverted. For an MVP, this can be in the form of a native system notification that informs the user of the revert, and gives them the option to navigate to the Wikidata page in question (via mobile web), or to the talk page of the user who did the revert (also via mobile web).\n\nHowever, this kind of notification is only possible for a logged-in user (it's not possible for anonymous IP edits). Therefore, we're considering the following options:\n* Require logging in when editing descriptions.\n* Limit the number of anonymous edits from the current device to a certain number (5?) before requiring the user to log in.\n\nOne other possibility for feedback to an anonymous user might look like this:\n* The user makes an edit to a description.\n* The app remembers the article and the description that was made.\n* The app starts a background service that periodically checks the description of that article. If it detects that the description is no longer the same as what the user edited, it shows a notification for the user.\n* This service would need to have a lifetime (e.g. 1 day?) after which it will stop polling for changes, to conserve data usage.\n\n'''Are there other ideas for user feedback during/after the editing workflow?'''\n\n== Comments ==\n* just my 2cents: I really like the general idea. More detailed comments:\n** I don't think we should spend any time on tracking reverted changes for not-logged-in users. Users should be told that there are plenty of advantages if they log in, such as the tracking, but setting up the infrastructure and code to do it for them not-logged in - no\n** Before I add the option of easy editing of descriptions, it would be great to be able to efficiently monitor descriptions on the fly too! If I am logged in, I would be really interested in seeing and patrolling all changes to descriptions in topics I am interested in my language. If I could do patrolling on the fly, I would be much less worried about vandalism on the fly. But only improving the tools for one side to the detriment of the other side feels wrong.\n** Basically we have three options: allow anonymous edits, allow 5 edits before requiring login, require login. I can't tell the tradeoff between these three - i.e. how much vandalism occurs in each of them - and I would suggest to tackle this experimentally.\n** I really like the idea of being notified when a revert happens, but really that should be something the app does in general! :D - but yes, here and in particular, too.\n** I love the idea of using Wikidata descriptions as the \"gateway drug\" to Wikipedia editing\n--[[User:Denny|Denny]] ([[User talk:Denny|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:30, 31 October 2016 (UTC)\n*An important point imho: it would be nice to add a screen with a shortened version [[Help:Description]] in order to let user knows what is expected (only a few words, do not start with a capitalisation in English...). This screen should be linked from the onboarding popup and the editing interface. I think it would really improve the quality of the descriptions submitted by good faith users and will reduce the patrolling work of Wikidata users/bots (less normalization required afterward). Hopefully it will decrease the number of cases like \"I thought that descriptions should start with a capital letter so I have edited X descriptions to add a capital letter and I got reverted\". Also it would be nice that, in the implementations, the examples follow carefully [[Help:Description]] recommendations.

At some point, not only in the help section, should the user be confronted with where they're editing.

The [http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec], for exemple add, when is know the native languages names of a places, but most of the languages, like {{Q|13339}}, {{Q|1185119}}, {{Q|56590}} or {{Q|13351}} are not supported by Wikidata.

We use MediaWiki core's <code>wmgExtraLanguageNames</code> setting for this, which has weird effects like being able to select this language in your setting but not having any localization except for the language name itself, which is always shown in it's own language, and never translated.

The problem here is that it's not clear to users how to get new languages added. We have a page explaining the process and criteria for new monolingual text languages (although it's not very visible) but there is nothing for label languages. From what you said, it seems like there is a reason to have separate criteria for labels and monolingual text, so we should create a page similar to [[Help:Monolingual text languages]] but for label languages. Could you help with that? I can try drafting a page but I would need help with some of the details. The main things I don't know are:\n::::::* Which languages will be considered? A valid non-private [[:en:IETF language tag]] (BCP 47 code) seems like the bare minimum, but are there any additional restrictions? What about country variants, script variants, dialect or orthography variants, ancient/extinct languages, constructed languages?\n::::::* What needs to be done before the language will be added? You mentioned adding it to MediaWiki core and TranslateWiki - how does a user go about doing that? It looks like Incubator has information about TranslateWiki ([[:incubator:Help:Manual#Step_5:_Localisation|here]]) but how much needs to be translated for it to count? Is there anything else?\n::::::* What information does the user need to provide? The language code would be the most obvious thing. What else? Language name in the language itself? Language name in English? Script?

The \"correct\" parent taxon is the one from the most complete taxonomic picture known to date. If there's ''real scientific disagreement'' about what taxon that is, that's one thing, but that's categorically ''not'' the case here. The databases listing Vertebrata and Tetrapoda as the parent of Mammalia do ''not'' make any claim of completeness, or even completeness with respect to the current state of knowledge--several purposely ''exclude'' known clades with only one surviving sub-clade, because their focus is on extant species only. They do ''not'' challenge the existence of the dozen or more firmly-established intervening clades, including Synapsida, Therapsida, and Cynodontia; ''no'' literature does. They do ''not'' support claims of Vertebrata or Amniota being the ''closest'' parent taxon to Mammalia. Of the above taxa, only Mammaliformes is considered the closest parent by literature that ''does'' claim to reflect the complete state of present knowledge. No taxonomist disputes the existence of reliably, formally, and consistently identified speciation events ''between'' vertebrate and mammal. Not listing every clade doesn't make a database wrong, just incomplete; ''explicitly'' claiming vertebrata or amniota as the closest known parent taxon of mammalia, as you want to do, is wrong, wrong, wrong. {{ping|Brya|Faendalimas|Lymantria}} you can surely confirm that. --[[User:Swpb|Swpb]] ([[User talk:Swpb|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:35, 13 February 2017 (UTC)\n:::Ok, under the current rules of nomeclature only the major categories have to be used, for one thing, ie species, genus, family, order, class, etc... Which means listing class mammalia under phylum chordata is perfectly reasonable, most of us use the subphylum however which is vertebrata. A second and important point is that the vertebrate paleos (ie fossilworks) largely use phylocode as their classification system rather than the ICZN and while working within paleontological specimens only you can probably get away with this, however, despite what many paleontologists like to think, and I work as both a taxonomist and a paleontologist, phylocode is not an accepted set of nomenclatural rules and hence cannot be used for living taxa. Hence phylocode which names all clades is not the most correct nomenclature for groups when discussing all mammals for instance. You also need to separate nomenclature from taxonomy. If taxonomy has named several of the intervening clades between vertebrata and mammalia, good for it, those names have no meaning in nomenclature and do not have to be used. So there is no wrong or right about it. The only correct answer is that mammals belong to chordata, everything else in between is optional and has no nomenclatural support. Like I said generally it is accepted to use vertebrata, the sub-phylum, and it would be considered strange not to do so, but the name Mammaliformes is phylocode, and from a nomenclatural point of view only is invalid. Use it if you wish but it cannot be enforced under the rules of nomenclature. Despite what the literature says which on that name is mostly paleontological. Sorry but you will not get the answer you want because when it comes to names the taxonomy effects how names are used, only nomenclature rules if a name can or must be used.

Such pages range from [[w:homograph]]s to [[w:synonym]]s, former is more common but the later is not unusual at all. On Wikidata we have [[Special:ItemDisambiguation]] which is a bit of both. It does allow lookup of items by the label but it also includes items identified by aliases. If this is changed from only working on the repo to also working on the client, then we would have a working disambiguation page that includes ''more'' items than presently connected on Wikipedia. We could then link to local pages where those exist, but use the special page \"AboutTopic\" for all entries that don't exist locally. Such links should be visually different, and in the example they are shown in italics.\n\nA page like this needs a clear and concise link, and I believe the correct place would be in the content sub right below the page title.

It is although related to the contents ''title''.\n\nThe data from the page should be available on a special page, but if it contains few enough entries it could open as a drop down menu. This menu would use [[mw:Extension:Cards|Cards]] like in the article footer for [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Related pages|related articles]] and the special page for [[mw:Beta Features/Nearby Pages]]. Only 8-10-12 -ish pages should be linked in a menu, if there are more pages then the user must go to the special page.\n\nBy exposing the labels, aliases, and descriptions like this at the clients the users at those projects will get more ownership to the entries in the items, thereby developing a sense of \"working together\". Because this will link to \"AboutTopic\" it will be a lot easier to find a starting point for creating new articles, not to forget a place to manage labels, aliases and descriptions for the disambiguation entries themselves.\n\nNote that this discussion could go on Meta, as it relates to several projects, but it is most easily implemented as part of the Wikibase client. It will also have a pretty large impact on maintenance of items, they would be exposed a lot more and thus be edited more, so it seems wise to start the discussion on this project.

As part of the reference structure for these statements, we add {{P|813}} to signify when the claim was checked against the database. An example item is [[Q27553062#P31|here]] or [[Q4117777#P279]]. We run the bots regularly (depending on the data source, ranging from weekly to monthly), to check this data against the primary source, and would like to update the retrieved statements to indicate that this value was checked. However, this leads to many \"blank\" edits, where the only thing that changes are the dates. [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q4117777&type=revision&diff=480833113&oldid=480832655 Here] is an example. \n\n'''Arguments for updating time stamps every time a bot checks a statement:'''\n* This allows a person to know when the last time a statement<s>s</s> was checked without themselves checking the external source\n* This allows queries to make use of this information in data retrieval\n* If an external resource goes down, it is valuable to know when the data was last checked\n\n'''Arguments against:'''\n* These edits obscure<s>s</s> edit histories and make<s>s</s> it more difficult for a person to figure out when a certain statement was created or updated.

We are proposing that we stay with this procedure, but additionally update all time stamps on all statements every 6 months. The \"maintenance\" revisions could be labelled or tagged as such.\n\n==Discussion==\nInteresting question. Some thoughts:\n* Reference retrieval dates, as they are typically used in most Wikimedia projects, are not updated each time the value is re-confirmed. This is mostly the case because there are barely any automatic routines in place, and no human editor would waste their valuable time with such edits. This has in fact changes with Wikidata and the possibility to use bots for this task.\n** I don't see an advantage with frequent updates, since users are not used to such behavior. We assume a reference to be correct as long as nobody invalidates it after it went offline.\n** However, annual update (or, maybe, all six months) would be fine and tolerable for me. A useful, explanatory edit summary should be provided.\n* An alternative to temporally narrow down changes regarding reference availability would be to make the full crawl log available at Tool Labs.\n** Create a tool account (if you don't have one yet), and provide a mask to filter the log with different, useful parameters. This would reduce the server load on the Wikidata side.\n** Advertise the tool within suitable Wikiprojects.\nRegards, [[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:51, 7 May 2017 (UTC)\n\n: I have definitely run into this issue with some of the data sources I've used myself. An added twist is for a database that time-stamps itself, so that the reference URL (or other aspects of the citation) changes with each release. When I re-ran a bot in that case, many statements ended up with two (or more) separate references, for the two instances of the database that had the same information. I wonder if this is maybe an issue that the [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite Wikicite project] should take up? Provenance in wikidata is important, we want to encourage good practices here.

From a consistency point of view, {{p|577}} has to be preferred because this is the most accurate way to date a statement. {{p|813}} is just a lazzy solution to avoid to look for the publication date in the database. Most databases provided the date of the last change so bots have to look for that date and see if this publication date is different from the one available in WD statement. If no difference, no need of changing anything in WD. \n: Some databsases are updating their data only once every ten years. Example: population data from census offices. So updating every month or every year the data in WD is stupid. Should we wait 10 years to check the data ? No. \n: Here we can find the difference between update and check. An update means something is changing and this should be displayed in WD. A simple check just means that we verify that the data is always correct according to the original set of data.\n: My conclusions: \n:* Bots have to follow the sourcing policy and to use as much as possible {{p|577}} instead of {{p|813}}\n:* A difference has to be made between an update and a simple consistency check: the first one means a change in the original database and this has to be recorded in WD, the second one has to be as much as possible offline (using a dump for example) and should not lead to any automatic update.\n:* Discrepancies detected during check should not be automatically corrected in order to avoid bots wars. Every check should generates a report and this report should be analyzed by humans in order to understand the reasons of the changes. This is perhaps a vision of an ideal world, but this is the only smart one: just running bots without checking they did is just non sense work. \n:* Data check and data uptdate should be coordinated with change rates of original databases. If a database performs an update every year, the update should be done in the same way.

In short, I see a strong numerical advantage (factor of 3) and slightly better argumentation of those who want to allow addition of redirects. I would call this '''consensus to add redirects to Wikidata items'''.\n\n'''However''', there are very strong issues surrounding this conclusion, some of which have been discussed properly, and some have been mentioned but not properly discussed.\n* I would say there is also '''consensus''' that not all redirects should be added to Wikidata, but only those redirects which help to solve existing problems are welcome. Indiscriminate addition of redirects, and, even worse, creation of redirects followed by their indiscriminate addition, is clearly not welcome and probably will be considered as disruption. This argument was raised by both supporters and opposers, and has not been convincingly rebutted.\n** Given that we currently have no mechanism of redirect addition (except for twice moving articles on the projects, which is a clear disruption and I am sure will be perceived as such on the projects), before the phabricator task can be opened we need to discuss some policies on when redirects can be added, by whom and how. These questions were not properly addressed in this RfC. For example, one suggestion was that redirects must be added in such a way that constraint violations are not created, however, there was no proper discussion of this point.\n* There was also a suggestion that redirects must be clearly visible and discriminated from other links. Ideally, they should not only be human-readable, but also bot-readable. Again, this needs to be discussed.\n* I am sure during the implementation some other issues will surface out. Opposers point out to some of the issues (for example, read Lydia's comment carefully).

The English Wikipedia has one article for {{Q|219937}} while when Wikidata was founded in 2012 the Dutch Wikipedia had only an article for {{Q|2319886}} and one for {{Q|3320282}}. In this case the problem got practically solved by creating redirects from the items {{Q|2319886}} and {{Q|3320282}} to {{Q|219937}} and the Dutch created their own article for {{Q|219937}}.\n\nHowever the same problem appears in other contexts and the defacto solutions of creating the redirects is inhibited by the Wikidata software.\n\nThe 'Bonnie and Clyde problem' is bad because Wikipedians expect us to provide interwiki links and get unhappy when we don't have a good solution and have to tell them to add the interwiki links manually on their Wiki. It's a failure on our part if we have to tell them that we can't solve them and they have to add the interwiki links the old way. [[User:ChristianKl|ChristianKl]] ([[User talk:ChristianKl|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:14, 28 May 2017 (UTC)\n\n{{Ping project|Cross Items Interwikis}}\nObviously this has been discussed before - we even have a WikiProject nominally devoted to it, which I just pinged, which has a list of other problem cases to think about. I (Arthur) have also advocated for allowing redirects but it actually does not \"solve\" the 'Bonnie and Clyde' problem, which is fundamentally a User Interface issue for the language wikipedias. I'll comment below on why I think redirect links (or an alternative) would be helpful for wikidata. To fix wikipedia's \"Bonnie and Clyde\" UI issue I think the best approach is to use an item's \"part of\" (or \"parent organization\" etc) and \"has part\" relationships to augment the automatic inter-language links that are currently based only on having a common wikidata item. Wikidata linking to redirects helps slightly by adding these links on one side (from the more granular to the less) but it also confuses the assumption that the different language articles are actually about the same thing. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:16, 30 May 2017 (UTC)\n:Some of the relationships are more subtle than \"part of\", the potato problem is a good example.

For the purposes of the German Wikipedia the streets aren't individually notable but for our purposes they are clearly identifiable conceptual or material entities that can be described using serious and publicly available references and thus is are notable.\nThat means an item like {{Q|30076706}} has a place on Wikidata. The item can be linked from OpenStreetMap.\n\nThe German article that lists the street contains interesting information for someone who wants to know about {{Q|30076706}}. It tells the reader that the street got it's name on 8. Jan. 1892 and is named after [[:de:Johann Cicero|Johann Cicero]] while it was previously named Stra\u00dfe 41. It's useful for a reader who comes to Wikidata from OpenStreetMap to have the redirect to be able to continue to the German Wikipedia.\n\nWhenever Wikidata has a higher resolution than Wikipedia, redirects are useful. Wikidata can have entries for all ICD illnesses but the individual Wikipedia often batch multiple ICD numbers together to a single article. It's useful to still have links from Wikidata to the Wikipedia article that describe the illnesses even when \n\nWon't this cause the individual redirects to create more redirects than they currently do? Yes, it would and that's great. Having more redirects makes it easier for users to find what they are looking for.

The latter perspective is the one taken by those who feel that it's better to put a redirect link than no link at all. \n\nTo some extent, those two goals are partly conflicting goals. So what does one do about that? The principal reason ''I'' use Wikidata is to manage interwiki links. So I know what I want from this, and my !votes below reflect that. Truthfully, though, I don't much care ''how'' we get to this point, as long as we ''do'' get to the point. If it's done by \"virtual sitelinks\" as [[User:Succu]] suggests below, I'm ok with that. If it's done by allowing many-to-one sitelinks, as long as they're not redirects, I'm ok with that. If the latter in fact allows many-to-one-including-sections sitelinks, all the better.

Consider {{Q|Q3481993}}. hewiki, yiwiki and frwiki all have separate articles on the subject. Enwiki does not, but covers it in some detail within the larger article on Passover. The redirect there points directly to the section on the subject of the Seventh Day of Passover. So to the extent available within enwiki, it takes you to the best possible location in the project. I don't think that Wikidata has the right to insist to the other projects that they have to have an article on a given topic.

Bonnie and Clyde is a cute example, but this goes '''much''' deeper than that. For example, see {{Q|Q3621491}} - which redirects to {{Q|Q23498}} on enwp, but there's no evidence of that here - and the same applies across different occupations. Or for telescopes (my pet project for Wikidata infoboxes), it makes sense to have an entry for smaller telescopes here but on enwp they are often covered in the observatory article rather than having a separate one - and we just can't handle that here right now.

Well, try to understand this: Wikidata provides a service, not a stand-alone resource. Its value is in how it can be used by other systems, such as Wikipedia and the sister projects, as well as third-parties. Think about it: how many people looking for information about Howard Carter would go to {{Q|Q133682}} and how many would go to [[:en:Howard Carter]]? The point of Wikidata is to make information ''programmatically'' available. At present I can auto-populate the infobox at [[:en:Howard Carter]] from Wikidata with his citizenship, places of birth and death, and so on, all properly linked to the corresponding articles, but I can't directly link to his occupation because {{Q|Q3621491}} doesn't provide the calling code with a site-link to [[:en:archaeologist]], simply because Wikidata refuses to accept that the redirect to [[:en:archaeology]] is a sensible convenience. How does that improve the usage of Wikidata for readers of the English Wikipedia? So the opposers are going to tell me that having a site link from {{Q|Q3621491}} to [[:en:archaeologist]] is heresy, because a reader following that link would be astonished to find themselves at the article [[:en:archaeology]]. What nonsense. Readers follow links labelled ''archeologist'' to the article on 'archeology' all the time, and there's not been one complaint demanding that enwiki create a separate article for ''archeologist''. Forget about the direct use of inter-language links on Wikipedias; that's trivial compared to the potential for auto-creating content in smaller wikis that don't have the editor base to create articles at the rate that information is streaming into Wikidata. What about the potential for dynamically created lists? But if I write code to generate a list of 20th century anthropologists, I want Howard Carter's entry to have a link to an article that discusses his occupation as an Egyptologist (that would be [[:en:Egyptology]]), but Wikidata refuses to allow {{Q|Q1350189}} to hold that link.

The close connection to Wikipedias has been incredibly useful to start and grow Wikidata, and we should keep it strong. Nevertheless, I am open regarding the technical solution chosen. Allowing sitelinks to have section anchors (fragments) seems to be a slightly more attractive approach that gives Wikidata more control (e.g., this would address the concerns that redirects on Wikipedia change too often and we would not notice). On the other hand, after thinking about concrete cases, I have doubts regarding the \"virtual sitelinks\" idea brought up by [[User:Succu]]: it seems very topic-dependent what type of property would lead to a reasonable \"virtual sitelink\" and there might be confusingly many (e.g., consider the relation of \"Homer Simpson\" to \"The Simpsons\" -- surely not \"part of\", but there might also be a \"part of\" link to something else). So, given what I heard so far, my preference order would be: \"sitelinks with fragments\" (possibly with automatic mechanisms to check if the anchor still exists in the target page) > \"sitelinks to redirects\" > \"virtual sitelinks\". But I remain convinced that solving this problem can help both Wikipedia & Wikidata readers (by adding meaningful links where we have nothing now) and Wikipedia & Wikidata editors (by helping them to discover related information on Wikipedia even when there is no dedicated article). Overall, it will improve coherence. The use of fragments would make it easier to filter \"real sitelinks\" from \"section sitelinks\", so this useful functionality should be preserved. --[[User:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch]] ([[User talk:Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 06:03, 22 August 2017 (UTC)\n#: <strike>{{strong support}} --[[User:Mauerquadrant|Mauerquadrant]] ([[User talk:Mauerquadrant|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 05:37, 25 August 2017 (UTC)</strike>\n#::You can't vote twice.

As a Wikisource editor, I see this as an elegant solution to the problem of [[:s:Wikisource:Wikidata#Works|works vs. editions]]. If English Wikisource has only one edition of a work, it is common practice to create a redirect from the work page to the edition page, e.g. from [[:s:Ave verum corpus]] to [[:s:Catholic Hymns (1860)/Hail to Thee, true Body]]. Per established consensus, the Wikidata item [[Q790327|Ave verum corpus]] should be linked to the work page at [[:s:Ave verum corpus]], and NOT to the edition page at [[:s:Catholic Hymns (1860)/Hail to Thee, true Body]]. Allowing Wikidata to link to a redirect will resolve this issue nicely.

You deserve better than this from me. The main reason it took me so long (besides being super busy) is that I've really struggled with this complex topic.\n\nThere are very good reasons for people to want to link to redirects. Based on the comments here the by far biggest point is wanting to link between different Wikipedia language versions even if the concepts don't quite match up in the articles. That's a fair and understandable request.\n\nThere are however also very good reasons to not do it. The sitelinks are a part of what defines what an item is about. At first this seems trivial but there is a whole lot behind it. For example we have tools that import data from Wikipedia infoboxes and categories as well as from outside databases. Quite some of them rely on the sitelinks to identify a concept. I have seen way too many import mistakes already simply because the concepts were not separated correctly. Suddenly you end up with data about a particular episode of a TV show in the item for the TV show and so on. That is really bad from a data consumer side. Another issue is the creation of duplicate items. The check that makes sure that one article is only linked in one item is a huge help in finding duplicates and maintaining our data that I'd rather not lose. Redirects also have very different semantics (typos, broader concept, narrower concept, different facet, ...) and it isn't clear how to keep the \"good\" ones apart from the \"bad\" ones consistently. And last but not least there are the parser functions and Lua modules that take data from the connected item by default. It isn't clear which item they should be getting their data from if more than one item is connected with an article.\n\nTaking all this together I think we need to figure out ways to give the Wikipedias the sitelinks they want without linking to redirects. The best suggestion I've seen so far (which would also reduce duplication of information) is the idea of generating some sitelinks automatically based on statements. I'd like to explore this further with you and see if this is feasible. As a next step it'd be great if we can collect specific cases to see which statements could provide a large number of them without too much overhead. --[[User:Lydia Pintscher (WMDE)|Lydia Pintscher (WMDE)]] ([[User talk:Lydia Pintscher (WMDE)|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:38, 31 January 2018 (UTC)\n: Not surprisingly I agree. --[[User:Succu|Succu]] ([[User talk:Succu|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:45, 31 January 2018 (UTC)\n:: {{ping|Lydia Pintscher (WMDE)}} I don't think some of these arguments add up:\n::* {{tq|too many import mistakes already simply because the concepts were not separated correctly}}.  Allowing links to redirects ''helps'' better separation of concepts on Wikidata.  At the moment people are forced to link articles for all related concepts into a single Wikidata item here, if they want to keep interwiki functionality. But when redirect pages can be sitelinked to Wikidata items, then it becomes possible to have the main articles sitelink to different (more precise) Wikidata items, without losing the interwiki functionality.  Making this possible is actually a stepping stone to much ''better'' definition and distinction of concepts here, and data import from ''more'' accurately corresponding counterparts on wiki.\n::* {{tq|parser functions and Lua modules that take data from the connected item by default}}.  An article will still only connect to a single item via a sitelink.  That is the item information will be drawn from.  The redirect page will connect to a different item -- but the redirect page won't have an infobox on it.\n::* {{tq|The check that makes sure that one article is only linked in one item is a huge help in finding duplicates and maintaining our data}}.  This is very true.  But one wiki-page would still only be linked to one item, and vice-versa.  We need to think of the process here.  Where do bad sitelinks to redirects come from?  Mostly, because two articles have been merged on the target wiki, but the corresponding items have not been merged here.  That happens now, and the software doesn't stop it.  What the software does stop is making a 'good' sitelink to a redirect.  It is probably true that most current sitelinks to redirects are 'bad'.  But a reasonable way forward for dealing with this (which people have voted for with their feet) is to have a mechanism to identify the consciously-created good ones and distinguish them.  On en-wiki this is done by marking the redirect page with [[:en:Template:Wikidata redirect]].  As the wikidata item {{Q|16956589}} reveals, this now has counterparts on eight wikis, including French, German, and Russian. With this marker, redirects with the template can be whitelisted as intentional, redirects without it can be considered suspect, and targeted for evaluation/clean-up.\n::* One needs to make sure one is looking at this the right way round.  The proposal on this page is to allow sitelinks to redirect pages on Wikipedias.  It is not about allowing sitelinks to redirect items on Wikidata.  Most of your objections seem to be framed as if thinking about the latter, not the former.\n::[[User:Jheald|Jheald]] ([[User talk:Jheald|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:37, 31 January 2018 (UTC)\n\n:::I share her concerns that a mixture or actual sitelinks and redirects in the sitelink section is rather dangerous. If at all an apporach similar to sitelinks would be chosen for implementation, one would probably rather invent a new \u201credirects\u201d box in the web frontend, and of course a separate handle in the data model (something else than <code>schema:about</code>), in order to cleanly keep sitelinks and redirects apart from each other. This RfC unfortunately did not really address practical problems about the request enough, but I guess the actual implementation would not really play a role if it effectively improved the sitelink management in difficult cases.

So if we kept actual sitelinks and redirects together, we would have to invent an expensive mechnism of continuous checks whether all sitelinks that are not marked as redirects are still sane, and we would probably also have to align a lot of redirect sitelinks manually. I am not sure whether this scales properly, since the number of redirect sitelinks would quickly explode. It is also very bad if redirects were delivered as sitelinks to data users (e.g. via Query Service), since they expect a 1:1 correspondence to the item as they are used to, not something that is somehow related. Consider such a query to be an input source for an import procedure and you see how this could go wrong if the 1:1 correspondence does not hold any longer \u2026 \u2014[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 23:31, 31 January 2018 (UTC)\n::::::{{reply to|MisterSynergy}} There's a flag in the [[:mw:Manual:page table|page table]] as to whether a page is a redirect.

Keep the UI that tries to convert a redirect to its target article. Keep the UI that warns you when that target article already exists as an interwiki assigned to a different Wikidata item. But instead of ''disallowing'' adding the redirect anyway, with the error message \"if the two topics are the same you can merge them\", offer an option in that error message to add the redirect anyway.}}  And at that point, then also add the template {{Q|16956589}} to the redirect page, so that it can be distinguished as a redirect sitelink that has intentionally created from Wikidata, rather than a redirect sitelink that is a sitelink that has been left over after a merge on-wiki but not on wikidata.\n::::::It is worth remembering that it is the ''redirect page'' that would be returned by WDQS, not the wikipage that is the target of the redirect.  Even if the redirect page were then to be an input source for an import procedure, the impact would be very limited, because there the redirect page would contain no data to scrape, just the redirect template.  But I agree that if we're keeping a local record of which linked pages are redirects, it would be useful to include that in the triplestore.  And it should be easy enough. We already include the triples <syntaxhighlight lang=\"sparql\" inline>?article schema:about ?item </syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"sparql\" inline>?article schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikipedia.org/></syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"sparql\" inline>?article wikibase:badge ?badge</syntaxhighlight>, so one would just need to introduce another value of badge.  Or one could create a new <code>wikibase:</code> predicate as well.  If we were going to keep a local record anyway, maintaining that as part of the RDF update stream should be very easy to include.

A redirect page has a title that is distinct from the title of the page it links to; that page title helps define more precisely what that wikidata item is about. If you have a wikipedia page about a foundation named after a particular person, and the page with the name of that person redirects to the foundation page, then it is helpful to have a sitelink to that redirect on the wikidata item about the person, rather than just having one sitelink on the item about the foundation. In cases like that I don't care if there are any inter-language links to any other language; the existence of the two sitelinks in a single language better defines the two wikidata items.

[[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:37, 12 February 2018 (UTC)\n\n* {{ping|Lydia Pintscher (WMDE)}} In terms of infoboxes, we tried that approach by using <nowiki>{{#ifexist}}</nowiki> statements (in parser functions or in lua code) to check, e.g., for combinations of parameters (e.g., [[:en:Palomar Mountain, California]] rather than [[:en:Palomar Mountain]], [[:en:California]]). It sort of works, but it unfortunately also creates phantom \"what links here\" entries, a bug that dates back to 2007. See [[:m:2017 Community Wishlist Survey/Miscellaneous/Stop ifexist checks from appearing in Special:WhatLinksHere]] for a writeup. If that's fixed, then that would help somewhat, but I don't think that can solve the problem - you then end up writing more and more complex code to deal with the edge cases. Being able to store information about redirects on Wikidata, and then to be able to query which ones exist rather than guess what might be there, would simplify things a lot. Thanks. [[User:Mike Peel|Mike Peel]] ([[User talk:Mike Peel|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:24, 15 February 2018 (UTC)\n\n* Dear all WMDE staffs, I think instead of allowing redirects, how about allowing more than one sitelinks for one site entry which is bumped again and again in [[phab:T54971]]? In this way, we can set up just one set of statements for all kinds of articles in single interface, rather than trying bot to sync such things. --[[User:Liuxinyu970226|Liuxinyu970226]] ([[User talk:Liuxinyu970226|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 08:02, 18 February 2018 (UTC)\n\n* I support {{u'|Lydia Pintscher}}'s proposal to generate some sitelinks automatically based on statements. This gets users the links while preserving data quality and a 1:1 relationship between Wikidata items and their associated Wikipedia article. I just hope this is implemented soon, as this page indicates that this is a major issue. [[User:Daask|Daask]] ([[User talk:Daask|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:06, 31 March 2018 (UTC)\n\n* I just want to put in my two cents (or repeat them, from above): We who work on Wikipedias (and the like) need a way to sllow some interwiki links to go to places that are something other than ordinary, stand-alone pages. Because Wikidata and different Wikipedias all have differnt levels of granularity, insisting that only one-to-one correspondences will do is just not practical. We really do understand why, from a pure database perspective, a pure one-to-one correspondence is the most desirable way to go. But if it's not practical, what do you do, then?\n*: Mostly, I am indifferent to the mechanism used, as long as the mechanism is something that ordinary Wikipedia contributors can easily handle. One reason that redirects are popular is that ordinary Wikipedia contributors can handle them. And on the whole, we can handle them even in languages where we are not very fluent. \n*:* Personally, I really like best the idea of allowing redirects when the redirect has been marked with a template saying \"this was done intentionally for this purpose\". It creates a nominal page on the target wiki representing the topic (thereby creating the skeleton of one-to-one correspondence), and the presence of the redirect gives a potential future author a place to work if s/he wants to build out the page in the future. And this is simple for Wikipedians to do. If we do this, I'd love the need to hack to do this disappear. But I can live with the hack; it's not that hard to do, and makes it more difficult for people simply to make random redirects, which none of us really want to see.\n*:* Still, I'm not wedded to the approach. If you were to tell me that I could add a real link to a section header (or any other anchor on a page), I'd do that. I think a number of people above have stated reasons they think this is not as good an approach, and I tend to agree. But what <u>I</u> want is a solution that works, and I can live with a less-than-optimal one.\n*:* And, again, to summarize: if we do this by statements instead, that's fine, too, as long as the way to do it is documented, and can be handled by an ordinary Wikipedian. I'm largely indifferent to the mechanism, as long as I get a solution. But I will strongly disapprove of making even the hack impossible. There needs to be a way to do this.

The most important thing (in my opinion) is that the data ''has'' references. If the data has references, people using the data can choose which ones they want to trust. Removing or disallowing Find A Grave references will not prevent people from using it as a source, we just won't know that they have. There is no limit on how many references a statement can have.

However, I note that neither BFI nor the newspaper you point to as sources for {{q|2991961}} death date (April 26, 2007) provide references, and the FindAGrave date (April 22) is supported also by IMDB. None of these meets a standard of \"verifiability\" beyond linking to the referenced source and seeing what it says. So, in a case like this, we should add the alternate stated date and its sources and leave it there as a disputed piece of information - if you suppress the April 22 entry you are hiding the fact that a disagreement exists. In the case of {{q|24169858}} I note that FindAGrave has a more precise death date than either of your references (which state only the year) so I'm wondering why you trust them more on the birth date? In the FindAGrave case, both birth and death dates can be further verified by examining the dates engraved on the gravestone, in the image provided there. So the FindAGrave values are MORE verifiable than the values from your other sources.

For the purposes of Wikidata, the website Findagrave is considered a \"serious\" source of data, and we recognize that it may contain typos and other errors, as do all data sets. At Wikidata when two sources differ, for example for the date of birth, the correct date is raised in rank, and a widely reported incorrect date is deprecated in rank. If it is inconclusive as to which is correct, the two dates are given the same rank. All Wikidata statements should be sourced. Findagrave typos and other obvious errors should be reported to Findagrave using their edit feature. For people born/died in the United States there are several databases containing birth and death dates that are based on official government documents such as birth certificate, marriage certificates, death certificates, and self reported documentation such as draft registrations, and passport applications. Even these dates may differ from each other. There are dozens of examples of people self reporting their birth dates in the WWI and WWII draft registration and giving different years for each. The same for people filling in passport applications. Generally the rule of thumb is that the document closest to the event in time, is more likely to be correct. For example the birth date given on a birth certificate is more reliable than the birth date given 20 years later in a draft registration or a passport application. --[[User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )|Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )]] ([[User talk:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 05:04, 30 October 2017 (UTC)\n:*[citation needed].

[[User:Nikkimaria|Nikkimaria]] ([[User talk:Nikkimaria|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 12:05, 3 July 2017 (UTC)\n::: As has already been pointed out to you, [[Wikidata:Verifiability]] is NOT a consensus document in wikidata, and is marked as such. [[Help:Sources]] is also somewhat outdated relative to current practice - as a Help page it is intended to be helpful, not to define consensus policy for this wikimedia site. Both could use people working on them to make them closer to agreement with current consensus, but that consensus is also evolving. Please review the recent RFC's on verifiability and living people to get a sense of where things are here. I don't understand why you think in any way removal of sourcing information is helpful or a good use of your time when there are so many other things in wikidata needing urgent attention. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:36, 3 July 2017 (UTC)\n::::I consider addressing poor sourcing to be an issue in need of urgent attention, but if you do not, develop a policy that says poor sourcing is a-okay. If current consensus is that Wikidata has no quality standards for sources, our policies, guidelines and help documentation should reflect that, so that everyone from newbies to experienced editors can see where things stand. [[User:Nikkimaria|Nikkimaria]] ([[User talk:Nikkimaria|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:15, 3 July 2017 (UTC)\n::::: If I could summarize, I believe the current consensus here is: use the best (most verifiable) source you have for data entry, but provide *some* source for every piece of data if possible. There is no consensus at this time for any deletion of sources, or  for any deletion of unsourced or poorly sourced statements; rather if possible better sources should be added when they can. However there are exceptions when deletion of sources is ok: when the source disagrees with the current value of a statement; or when a more recent edition of the source supports the statement (see recent RFC on updating from databases). There is no blacklist of \"unreliable\" sources or whitelist of reliable ones - I'm not sure we even agree that \"reliable\" is the right criterion for data - \"verifiable\" has been more consistently mooted here. It might be helpful if somebody tried to codify this via an RFC or some edits on Help:Sources etc, but I'm not sure what I've just phrased is even the general consensus at the moment. Feel free to attempt this yourself, but I suggest rereading all the relevant RFC and Proejct Chat discussions first. Bot approvals also often get into discussions of sourcing so you might want to look at the archive of recent bot approval requests.

It's not that there is generally a need for one person to create multiple accounts, but it's very easy to have more than six people wanting to create an account at an event, and as they tend to be using the same wireless network or same group of networked computers, then the account cap kicks in - since the blacklist can't distinguish between six different people or one person doing it six times. Getting them to create accounts in advance is ideal, but often not possible for various reasons, and IP-whitelisting is often also not possible.

            "page_text": "{{RFCSubpage|closed=yes}}\n== Introduction ==\nWikidata is in the process of growing up given that it just turned five. Growing up means getting more mature.\nIn it's [[foundation:Resolution:Biographies of living people|policy for biographies of living people]] the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees called on the global Wikimedia community to\n\"Ensuring that projects in all languages that describe living people have policies in place calling for special attention to the principles of neutrality and verifiability in those articles\". \nGiven that we are a project that describes living people it's time to do our part and also have an explicit policy instead of just informal decisions.\n\nIn addition, to fulfilling out duty, I consider this policy also to be valuable because it will make it easier to come to consensus around adding new properties. We had conflicts about new properties such as {{P|4174}} because some of us feared that having the property will lead to privacy solutions. With this policy, users that add a property like {{P|4174}} just because they know who's behind an account and who don't add a reference, will get an automated message telling them that their action is problematic. Not having an agreement about how privacy-sensitive {{P|2013}} and {{P|2035}} happen to be produced controversy in the grant proposal for [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants_talk:Project/Hjfocs/soweego soweego] that wouldn't need to happen when we implement the proposed policy.  \n\nBy defining terms clearly and labeling privacy-sensitive properties with structured data we allow various automated processes that will help us to protect privacy. Having a clearly outlined processes of how individuals who see their privacy violated can complain will make it easier for them to engage with us and allow us to become more aware of issues we need to fix.\n\nI created this RfC in the form that I consider to be best. To the extend that other people have different suggestions of how specific sections should be handled I invite everybody to add their own section to this RfC. <small>&nbsp;&ndash; {{Autotranslate|base=Unsigned/text|1=ChristianKl|2=15:28, 30 December 2017\u200e}}</small><!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned-->\n\n== Issues ==\n{{Discussion top|\n*consensus is reached to turn [[Wikidata:Living persons (draft)]] into a policy except the definition of living people.

While the English Wikipedia has a standard of requiring a source from the last two years to consider a person over 115 to be living I choose 10 years to be in the general spirit that there's a presumption of living.

The [[Wikidata:Bots]] policy already requests sourcing for bot-entered information. For bots that will be editing items about living people, it's recommended to explicitly address the following concerns during the bot approval process:\n::# If the bot will add information to items about living people that contains statements that use properties that subclass {{Q|44597997}} and {{Q|44601380}} the bot approval discussion must explicitly address the issue of why it's in this case okay to add the information. Such bots should not copy data from closed databases or books of limited circulation for this purpose.\n::# If the bot is importing from a Wikimedia project, does that Wikimedia project have an adequate [https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Biographies_of_living_people BLP policy]? If not further steps to verify the data before import are warranted.\n::# If the bot is pulling information from another source, is that source a reliable source for this data? Note that this is also important when adding statements with properties that don't subclass {{Q|44597997}} or {{Q|44601380}}.\n\n====Explanation====\nThis section voices general principles that would be good to follow. I however don't expect this to change much about the actual practice of bot approvals. Earlier drafts included a provision about a special flag for bot edits on living people.

Alternative accounts can already be used legitimately ([[Wikidata:Alternate accounts#Legitimate uses of alternate accounts|\"this is not a full and complete list [of accepted uses for doppelg\u00e4nger accounts]\"]]), and there is no rule that currently prevents someone from making and using one as long as they disclose its use publicly. Using an account ''only'' for adding sensitive information, while publicly linking that account to the person's main account, sort of defeats the purpose since ''all'' of that person's sensitive edits can be viewed at once.

Note that is the very first thing stated in EnWiki BLP policy.\n* The second sentence from EnWiki should also be substantially copied, specifying that such content must adhere strictly to all applicable laws in the United States as well as strict compliance with other policies. Living Persons Policy and Copyright Policy are not ordinary policies, they are both fundamentally grounded in law, and they then set a perimeter well clear of that law. That seriousness of the policy should be highlighted in the initial sentences.\n* In section '''Statements likely to be challenged''' the following sentence was copied from EnWiki policy: ''In the case of a dispute, the burden of evidence rests with the editor who adds or restores material.'' There are two problems:\n*# This must be moved out of the '''Statements likely to be challenged''' section. It addresses statements which actually are challenged. If a living person is described as dead/racist/nazi/whatever else, it doesn't matter whether or not it was in a pre-defined 'likely' category.\n*# The text was cut short. The two sentences after it must be included as well: ''If it is to be restored without significant change, consensus must be obtained first. Material that has been repaired to address concerns should be judged on a case-by-case basis.'' The entire point of the policy is that disputed Living Person content doesn't get treated like other content disputes. The content gets removed until the dispute is resolved. Without that, you don't have a Living Person's policy.\n* The crucial '''Definition of living person''' section is currently failing. As discussed in that section, replacement text should be substantially copied from EnWiki or a comparable BLP policy.\n\nThe items listed above are probably the most seriously flaws, and they are serious enough to render the policy worthless swisscheese. The entire policy should be reviewed in sentence-by-sentence comparison to EnWiki or other well established Living Person policy, with all relevant aspects copied or adapted as appropriate.

In my own work (UK politicians) there are a handful of common identifiers - P1614, P2015, etc - and it would make a lot of sense to have these always next to each other.\n::Maybe we could start out with a general rule of \"most common IDs first\" and then adjust that list so that there's some more natural grouping? New properties can then be tacked on at the end or inserted at a natural position in the sequence.

And even worse, a specialist in plant taxonomy could also be a specialist for something else for which there is also an \"important ID\", how do you know which specialization is more important on a per person basis? 2) Wrong values in Wikidata are not limited to ISNI.

Just a precisation: [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]] can technically manage also identifiers, ''but'' it cannot distinguish between classes of items, so it isn't possible to make VIAF or ISNI appear first ''only in human items'', but it is necessary to do it ''for all items''.

The Classical poet {{Q|316094}} has two values entered for him, one of which is a bad link, and the other leads to a mish-mash of data that has not been scrubbed by anyone.

To represent all the various version numbering schemes (for example, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH or MAJOR.MINOR.REVISION.BUILDNUMBER) adopted by softwares, I think we have two options:\n* create a property (and its inverse property) for every version type: we'll have \"major version\", \"major version of\", \"minor version\", \"minor version of\", \"build\", \"build of\", \"release\", \"release of\"... properties;\n* create only a \"software version\" property (different from {{P|P348}} because with an item datatype) and its inverse \"software version of\" AND consistently use <del>{{P|P3831}}</del>{{P|P548}} qualifier.\nHere are examples of the two options:\n=== Option 1 ===\nCreate a \"software version\" property and use <del>{{P|P3831}}</del>{{P|P548}} as qualifier in order to indicate the version type.\nOptionally, create a \"software version scheme\" to verify that the version scheme is respected. \n==== {{Q|Q1406}} ====\n{{Statement+|p=software version|v={{Q-|Q18168774}}|qp={{P-|P548}}|qv=major version}}\n==== {{Q|Q18168774}} ====\n{{Statement+|p=software version|v={{Q-|Q22686609}}|qp={{P-|P548}}|qv=minor version}}\n==== {{Q|Q22686609}} ====\n{{Statement+|p=software version|v=Windows 10.0.10586.3|qp={{P-|P548}}|qv=build}}\n\n=== Option 2 ===\ncreate \"major version\", \"minor version\", \"build\"... properties (all subproperties of \"software version\").\n==== {{Q|Q1406}} ====\n{{Statement+|p=major version|v={{Q-|Q18168774}}}}\n==== {{Q|Q18168774}} ====\n{{Statement+|p=minor version|v={{Q-|Q22686609}}}}\n==== {{Q|Q22686609}} ====\n{{Statement+|p=build|v=Windows 10.0.10586.3}}\n\n{{Ping project|Informatics}}\n== Comments ==\n\n* Note that {{P|348}} can already be qualified with the {{P|548}} property, whose values are instances or subclasses of {{Q|28530564}} -- such as {{Q|2804309}}, {{Q|2122918}}, {{Q|3295609}}, {{Q|7318449}}, {{Q|5209391}}, {{Q|20631656}}, etc. (see [https://query.wikidata.org/#SELECT%20%3Fitem%20%3FitemLabel%20WHERE%20%7B%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP31%2Fwdt%3AP279%2a%20wd%3AQ28530564%20.%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20%7B%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22en%22%20.%20%7D%0A%7D complete list]).<br/> I would suggest that we agree on a comprehensive ontology for these, and completing the gaps so that existing version statements in software items can be qualified appropriately. --[[User:Waldir|Waldir]] ([[User talk:Waldir|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 09:16, 22 May 2018 (UTC)\n\n:* {{Ping|Waldir}} The problem with {{P|348}} is it's a string-valued property, so it can't point to an item. I like the options suggested above, probably Option 1 is fine (and fine to use {{P|548}} as qualifier, I think that makes sense. But {{P|348}} would need to be changed to an item-valued property - see (and please comment on) [[Wikidata:Property proposal/software version]].\n:: A third option would be to only record version data in the reverse direction - see [[Wikidata:Property proposal/software version of]], and then I don't even think qualifiers are needed, can't we just indicate the version type via {{P|31}}??

That requires items for the versions, not strings. I wouldn't expect we would have one item for each version of every software product, just as we don't have one item for each human or star or whatever. If there's no need for any additional information, the present use of {{P|348}} is probably fine. But it does allow attaching additional information (such as release date, download size and URL's, etc.) to the version in a natural way, with references, etc. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:32, 22 May 2018 (UTC)\n:::::{{Ping|Waldir}}You're right, {{P|P548}} is better than {{P|P3831}}.\n:::::{{Ping|ArthurPSmith}}I support your proposal about recording version data only in the reverse direction but books don't do it.

I agree that being able to model additional statements per version item is important for Wikidata. For example, different file formats are associated in different ways with versions of some software.

It's also more tidy (if you ask me). - [[User:Premeditated|Premeditated]] ([[User talk:Premeditated|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:39, 11 July 2019 (UTC)\n* Strong {{oppose}}. It's unclear how you define version and revision and for what you want to create items. There are endless many different versioning schemes \u2013 the two you listed are only two of the more \"conventionally\" types of versioning, there are completely different schemes. Some projects use the date as version number (20190815) some use a compilation counter (3245646) or version-control-hashes (5eff689), the version-number of TeX is a number becoming closer and closer to Pi (current version is 3.14159265) Latex has currently the version \"2<sub>\u03b5</sub> Issue 29\" and and and\u2026 There is simply no way to add hierarchy like major, minor, bug\u2026 without distorting the reality. Version-numbers can only be strings, all further description has to be saved qualifiers or other properties. So the only option if we want to create items for every version is to create items for literally every version and release of every software. Considering that there are projects with huge amounts of releases it's unclear to me how this should scale. {{Q|12877}} has 15238 releases, {{Q|48524}} has even more since they have a rolling release-model in which every modification of the software gets a version number. Furthermore all Infoboxes in all Wikipedias have to be rewritten, probably also the Lua modules have to be improved for this. All the Bots updating version-numbers have to be rewritten. So creating items for software versions is a huge project. I'm not saying that this should not be done. But I'm saying that we cannot do it today. We lack of the resources to do something like that! There are way to few people updating software versions and the bots that we have lack developers to improve them. Consider alone the software in Arch-Linux: [https://tools.wmflabs.org/wdvaliditycheck/softwareversions.html there are ~300 outdated software-items] (some outdated for quite some time!), even through I updated thousands of software versions by hand and improved github-wiki-bot to update thousands of items. We should not make us way more work, when we can't handle the current amount of work to do \u2013 especially since the benefits are very small and vague. We can already map 99% of the information with {{P|348}} and qualifiers like {{P|548}}. Let us instead start to fix the urgent problems with software versions on Wikidata:\n** The descriptions of {{P|548}} are wrong (different from the English/German/French/\u2026 description) in some smaller languages\n** {{Q|2804309}} is not properly defined and differs between different languages \u2013 which is the reason why {{P|548}} isn't used widely!\n** github-wiki-bot neeeds improvements\n** Wrong ranks: https://w.wiki/77J\n** and most importantly: decrease the huge back-log.\n:-- [[User:MichaelSchoenitzer|MichaelSchoenitzer]] ([[User talk:MichaelSchoenitzer|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 00:33, 15 August 2019 (UTC)\n* {{support}} '''Option 1'''. Mainly because I prefer less properties with qualifiers over a lot of different properties. But I\u2018m not sure about creating items for every version. I think that just having the versions listed inside the main item should be enough in most cases --[[User:DaSch|DaSch]] ([[User talk:DaSch|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 06:47, 17 January 2020 (UTC)\n* {{oppose}} I agree with Michael.

The classification of a release as \"major\" or \"minor\" should not be forced onto all software, as not all software uses that release scheme. For certain large companies like Microsoft which have a well-defined versioning scheme, we can create their own classification of versions as \"major\" or \"minor\". Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1 in particular are ambiguous in this regard. Much better would be the ability to store the version history as a branched list of sorts, and either use a classification specific for a company or just let the consumer of the data decide.--[[User:Jasper Deng|Jasper Deng]] ([[User talk:Jasper Deng|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 01:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n*:{{ping|Jasper Deng}} This is at least impossible for the {{Q|83}}, where its versions can be new one-per-a week. --[[User:Liuxinyu970226|Liuxinyu970226]] ([[User talk:Liuxinyu970226|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 03:15, 14 May 2020 (UTC)\n*::{{ping|Liuxinyu970226}} I'm not sure what you mean here.

It's a good central reference. [[Help:Classification]] does not exist (it's a redirect to the Ontology Wikiproject now).\n**: The section about inverse properties seems very helpful to me; of course it could be moved to [[Help:Properties]]; at the least the two pages should refer to one another in this section (the section heading just above does link to [[Help:Properties]].)\n**: Colors probably should be moved to the \"by domain\" page, not on the general page, you're right about that\n**: There's lots of duplication all over the place - you should have seen it a few months ago! If you want to pare this one down further that would probably be helpful. As Jmabel said above, the page is definitely not \"final\", but it's much improved and I think provides an excellent central resource pointing to everything else that's relevant.\n**: In general, if we want to be helpful to newcomers here we need pages like this! [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:48, 11 July 2018 (UTC)\n:::: {{ping|ArthurPSmith}} If we want to help newcomers, we have to provide them a limited amount of help pages with a clear overview of the general organization of the help pages. So instead of creating 5 help pages with a dozen of sections having each one a link to one other help page or even several links, we better need 1 or 2 help pages with a very good section organization. Too much links just shows a lack of organization or common view, so this just leads to contradictions between examples or information as no global view is provided. \n:::: If [[Help:Modelling]] wants to be the general page so it should first start to provide a section with all help pages on the modelling topic and providing the relations between the help pages. Why don't I find your explanation about the different help pages in the first section of [[Help:Modelling]] ? How a newcomer can understand that [[Help:Modelling]]is a general page and [[Help:Basic membership properties]] is a specialized one ? And if I look at [[Help:Modelling/General#General]], it seems that your eyplanation is not correct as Help:Basic membership properties is described as a general topic.\n:::: You say that [[Help:Classification]] doesn't matter as it is a redirection, so why do we have to mention it in this help page ? Either the author of [[Help:Modelling]] never click the link to see what was in [[Help:Classification]] or [[Help:Classification]] was modified since the time the author was creating the link, and this is a perfect example of what I want to show when I speak about lack of global overview.\n:::: So I oppose to this help page because it starts from the wrong end: it goes directly to a bunch of examples without having a global view. How can I contribute to that page if I don't understand the organization ?\n:::: You say that the section about inverse properties was interesting. So what's about transitive properties, symmetric properties, asymmetric properties,... If this help page will reach the status of a general page then we shouldn't find examples, but definition. Instead of [[Help:Modelling/General#Inverse_properties]] we should find things like \"If a property ''p'' links individual ''a'' to individual ''b'', then the inverse property ''q'' links individual ''b'' to individual ''a''.\" One line which can replace a dozen of examples. [[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:59, 11 July 2018 (UTC)\n::::: I believe the original author of \"Help:Modelling\" started it years ago, so that's why there was a lot of cruft on it. This page has existed for many years in a draft mode; Jmabel finally (mostly) cleaned it up to a point where I think it is useful. If you have particular quibbles, you can go discuss them on the talk page or try to actually implement them on the page itself. However, replacing a collection of examples with a mathematical-like definition will most likely scare away 90% of the people who we should be trying to help, so I'm not sure you have the right frame of mind here for this kind of page.

'''Of course''' it should continue to evolve once it is no longer in draft status (as it has continued to evolve in the 3 weeks since I proposed this).\n:::::# I specifically tried to avoid the abstraction of formal logic with examples devoid of specific real-world meaning. I have a degree in mathematics, I can do formal logic just fine, but the reality is that most people can't and they are far more likely to be helped by a representative example than by dry formalism. If someone wants to put together a separate help page expressing these issues in strictly formal terms for those few who find that easier, that's fine with me, but it's a different thing.\n:::::# Yes, I apparently did not find 100% of the cruft in the page I inherited, only maybe 90%+ or so. So fix it. My own feeling is that if we wait till everyone is in perfect agreement that each help page is exactly as we want it before removing it from draft status, no help page will probably ever again make it out of draft status, especially because some disagreements about the best way to do things are not amenable to a solution that leaves everyone 100% happy: for example, if one person wants more formalism and another less, neither is ever going to be completely happy. - [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]] ([[User talk:Jmabel|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 00:46, 27 July 2018 (UTC)\n*: ''Why do we speak about a particular topic like [[Help:Modelling/General#Colors|colors]] in a general page like [[Help:Modelling/General]] ?'' I think I put this in this section because the \u00ab color \u00bb property itself is highly generic in the sense it concerns many many physical objects, from cars to chemical substances, by opposition to very specialized topic who do not concern at all other ontologies. The \u00ab generic \u00bb section is meant precisely for this actually, things that concerns many specialized topic. I think that being consistent in the way we treat colors for car and the way we treat colors for chemical substances is a good thing, for example. Generally it should be a benefit to take a look at the topics treated in the \u00ab generic \u00bb section before starting a specialized model to see which one are relevant. <span style=\"border: 1px #C9C9C9;\"><span style=\"background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;\">author&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;\">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 16:33, 11 July 2018 (UTC)\n\nWith 7 supports and 1 oppose, can we remove this from \"draft\" status?

However this would violate the P414 constraint as cryptocurrencies are traded although not being a company or business enterprise {{Unsigned2|11:48, August 2, 2018\u200e|Germartin1}}\n: Well, the short codes can certainly be added as aliases. If there is some standard database that lists these short codes as an ID, then I'd suggest proposing a specific property for that. I don't think P414 is the right choice here, but I could be wrong about that.

If a user is found to have multiple (unauthorized) accounts otherwise they should be handled under a socking policy I would have thought. And regarding users with a regular + a bot account, I think blocks should be handled differently for the two different cases. That is, I'd like a malfunctioning bot to be blocked immediately by admins, but I don't think that requires the associated user account to be blocked. Conversely, as Okkn suggests below, I don't think a user account that is blocked for one reason necessarily implies a bot account doing unrelated things should be blocked. So on its face I don't really understand this policy and I think I would oppose it as it stands.

Bots are essential infrastructure for this project and important in many regards to keep it running, so this proposal would create a lot of damage to the project. I would support bot account block only if the main account was blocked infinitely, or the bot account was abused to evade a temporary main account block, or if the bot is malfunctioning and the bot operator cannot address the concern due to their temporary block. I also note that there are a couple of bots operated by more than one operator, which makes it difficult to decide how to deal with them if this proposed policy became an actual policy. \u2014[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:28, 24 September 2018 (UTC)\n* {{o}} Per MisterSynergy. --[[User:Sannita|Sannita]] - <small>''[[User talk:Sannita|not just another it.wiki sysop]]''</small> 12:05, 25 September 2018 (UTC)\n* {{o}} [[User:SuccuBot]] was blocked on vague grounds that way. --[[User:Succu|Succu]] ([[User talk:Succu|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:56, 25 September 2018 (UTC)\n* {{o}}, I hate to be \"that guy\" but I'll have to bring up the local block of [[User:Daphne Lantier]] which was related to his vandalistic mass-deletion of \"highly visible\" pages on Wikimedia Commons and that \"leaked\" here through the fact that Wikidata edits are automatic, a user can edit Wikidata without their knowing, blocks should be to stop continued disruption, as much as I dislike the aforementioned user personally I have to give kudos to the handling administrators who didn't punitively block the [[User:INeverCry]] account here over edits that weren't in their own control. --<span style=\"border:1px solid yellow;padding:1px;\">[[User:Donald Trung|<font style=\"color:#FFFF00;background:red;\">'''&nbsp;\u5fb5\u570b\u55ae&nbsp;'''</font>]]</span> ([[User talk:Donald Trung|\u8a0e\u8ad6 \ud83c\udc04]]) ([[w:nl:Gebruiker:Donald Trung/Mijn werk \ud83c\udfe2|\u65b9\u5b54\u9322 \ud83d\udcb4]])  19:01, 25 September 2018 (UTC)\n* {{o}} - Mostly per ArthurPSmith.

It\u2019s the same for a number of cases, such as the {{P|27}} of someone : the country of citizenship s/he has no more are with normal rank, and the country of citizienship(s) the person has at present time are preferred. Help pages summaries this, for example {{Help|ranking}} and {{Help|evolving knowledge}} (created by the writer of these lines). A first question of this RfC concerns the relevance of the latter page.\n\nWhat I\u2019m not sure this actually answers the question of ranking of historical informations for historical entities or dead people. A good example is the countries of citizenships of {{Q'|[[Q937|Albert Einstein]]}}, who were Switzerland and USA at the time of his dead, but had values before. \n\nA case for \u00ab keeping stuffs as the time of disappearance of the entity \u00bb : it gives a natural way to find the most recent statements for evolving values for a property. If clients wants to get all the datas and not the most recent one they have to explicitely ask for them, just as with existing entities, thus keeping a kind of consistency. Less maintenance is required for when an entity disappears.\n\nA case for \u00ab moving the preferred ranks of evolving datas to normal rank \u00bb : all the datas are historical. There is no data that is actually valid at present time, for example if we list all the current citizens of Switzerland Einstein is not one of them as he\u2019s dead. \n\nA last option is to not decide anything here, but it implies that things are less predictible for data reusers, which do not make the data reuse easier.\n\nAn example of situation in which community asked itself the question is on the [[Property_talk:P26#Preferred_rank_and_dead_people|spouse property]]. Should the last spouse be on preferred rank ? \n|fr=\nLes pratiques actuelles sur l\u2019utilisation des rangs dans le cas de valeurs qui changent avec le temps, par exemple la population d\u2019une ville, est de ranger les valeurs anciennes en rang \u00ab normal \u00bb, et la valeur actuelle comme \u00ab pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00bb. L\u2019id\u00e9e est la m\u00eame pour bien d\u2019autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, par exemple le {{P|27}} de quelqu\u2019un : son ou ses pays de nationalit\u00e9 perdues sont not\u00e9es avec un rang normal, et ses pays actuels avec \u00ab pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb. Des pages d\u2019aides r\u00e9sument ceci, par exemple {{Help|ranking}} et {{Help|evolving knowledge}} (le dernier cr\u00e9\u00e9 par l\u2019auteur de cet appel \u00e0 commentaire). Une premi\u00e8re question concerne la pertinence de cette derni\u00e8re page d\u2019aide.\n\nCe qui n\u2019est pas forc\u00e9ment encore tr\u00e8s clair, c\u2019est l\u2019attitude \u00e0 adopter lorsque l\u2019entit\u00e9 disparait, par exemple \u00e0 la mort d\u2019une personne ou la destruction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent. Un bon exemple est le pays de nationalit\u00e9 d\u2019{{Q'|[[Q937|Albert Einstein]]}}, qui \u00e9tait Suisse et citoyen des \u00c9tats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique au moment de sa mort, mais qui fut aussi pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment par exemple allemand.\n\nIl est possible de \u00ab conserver les rangs comme lors de la disparition \u00bb : cela donne un moyen naturel de trouver les d\u00e9clarations les plus r\u00e9centes pour les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dont les valeurs sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00e9voluer dans le temps. Les consommateurs et clients des donn\u00e9es devraient dans ce cas, s\u2019ils veulent avoir toutes les valeurs, explicitement les demander (par exemple avec l\u2019API Lua utiliser \u00ab getAllStatement \u00bb et pas \u00ab getBestStatement \u00bb), exactement de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que les entit\u00e9s qui ne sont pas disparues, donc en conservant une certaine coh\u00e9rence. Une telle solution n\u00e9cessite peu de maintenance lors de la disparition des entit\u00e9.\n\nIl est \u00e9galement possible de \u00ab r\u00e9trograder les rangs \u00ab pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb au rang \u00ab normal \u00bb \u00bb. Le raisonnement est alors le suivant:  toutes les donn\u00e9es sont historiques. Il n\u2019y a plus de valeur valide au temps pr\u00e9sent, par exemple si nous listons tous les citoyens de Suisse d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui, Einstein n\u2019y figurerait pas.\n\nUne derni\u00e8re option est de ne rien d\u00e9cider ici, mais les implications en terme de facilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9utilisation des donn\u00e9es sont assez mauvaises et tendent \u00e0 ne pas simplifier la situation.\n\nUn exemple de situation dans laquelle la communaut\u00e9 s\u2019est pos\u00e9 la question est dans le cas [[Property_talk:P26#Preferred_rank_and_dead_people|des \u00e9poux]] (en anglais).

Metals mechanical properties heavily depends on the heat treating.\n\nHeat treating is then a mandatory qualifier to specify the value of the metal properties.\n\nThere is 2 ways of proceeding proposed so far :\n\n'''Way 1 : multiple properties'''\n\nA heat treating is a complicated process where many parameters will have an important impact. So that many properties are needed to describe it.\n\nIn example, for stainless steel {{Q|Q3334175}} : \n\n{{Statement+\n|rank=+1\n|P={{P-|5483}}\n|V=60\u00b11 HRC\n|q1.p={{P-|2076}}\n|q1.v1=23\u00b0C\n|q2.p=quenching temperature\n|q2.v1=1080\u00b0C\n|q3.p=cooling in\n|q3.v1={{Q-|283}}\n|q4.p=cryogeny temperature\n|q4.v1=-80\u00b0C\n|q5.p=cryogeny duration\n|q5.v1=2H\n|q6.p=tempering temperature\n|q6.v1=200\u00b0C\n|q7.p=tempering duration\n|q7.v1=2H\n}}\nA single material can go through several heat treatments. I.e. quenching + cryogeny + tempering is very common.\n\nTo get the number of needed qualifiers you have to multiply the quantity of heat treatement types by the quantity of possible parameters :\n* [[w:Heat_treating#Techniques|Technic of heat treatement]] : quenching, annealing, tempering, cryogeny, aging, normalizing, stress relieving, case hardening ...\n* Possible parameters for each type : athmosphere, duration, temperature, cooling in...\n\n'''Way 2 : storing heat treatment in an item'''\n\nSome heat treatments are normalized. For example the dedicated process for aging {{Q|Q24883840}} up to a {{P-|5479}} of 930 MPa is called +P930 :\n\n{{Statement+\n|rank=+1\n|P={{P-|5811}}\n|V=16%\n|q1.p={{P-|2076}}\n|q1.v1=23\u00b0C\n|q2.p=Heat treating\n|q2.v1=[[+P930]] <small>(Qxxx)</small>\n}}\n\nMost of other heat treatments phasis are not normalised but are very common. So that it could be interesting to have it stored in an item for reuse :\n\n{{Statement+\n|rank=+1\n|P={{P-|5483}}\n|V=60\u00b11 HRC\n|q1.p={{P-|2076}}\n|q1.v1=23\u00b0C\n|q2.p=Heat treating\n|q2.v1=[[Vacuum quenched at 1080\u00b0C]] <small>(Qxxx)</small>\n|q2.v2=[[2H cryogenic at -80\u00b0C or lesser]] <small>(Qxxx)</small>\n|q2.v3=[[2H tempering at 200\u00b0C]] <small>(Qxxx)</small>\n}}\n\nI would tend to way 2 because :\n* it avoid creating dozen of properties\n* the rendering is easier to read\n* it avoid the pain of specifying each parameter for each material since the items are reusable.\n\nWhat would be your opinion ?\n\nRegards \n\n--[[User:Thibdx|Thibdx]] ([[User talk:Thibdx|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 23:31, 2 December 2018 (UTC)\n:An heat treatment is a pattern of precise quenching-ageeing-tempering... That means, if you want to be precise, for me, the best is solution 2. [[User:Borvan53|Borvan53]] ([[User talk:Borvan53|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:18, 4 December 2018 (UTC)\n::This seems to be the general opinion if we refer to the discussion page but I'm wondering about practical use. This means that each time you add a property to the item you have to describe the heat treatment with something like 10 qualifiers.

The only case in which the pages should be protected or semi-protected is that of repeated and persistent vandalism, really when it has been proven that it can not be controlled in any other way.\n* I'm on the fence, but leaning towards not supporting for now. I would support this, but the sitelink issue could be problematic, as most Wikipedia editors are not autoconfirmed on Wikidata. If particular items are being vandalized a lot then they can usually be protected on a case-by-case basis; and a lot of potential vandalism targets can be watchlisted in large batches by adding them from Wikipedias' [https://tools.wmflabs.org/topviews/ topviews] reports (I would think vandalism is more closely correlated to Wikipedia page views than to item transclusions). Protecting important items would also negatively affect some edit-a-thons, particularly those focused on adding labels and descriptions in uncommon languages. I don't think I've ever come across more than one such edit-a-thon, though.

Even protecting single statements (bot-imported from a credible source and sourced -> no need for changing that, except, maybe, its \"ranks\"). I do not have a strong oppinion on this mass-protection yet. As an experiment (limited to a short set of items) it has some interest, but reaching previous community consensus would have been nice. Due to this \"lacking-consensus\" status, it doesn't matter to me whether these protections are mass-reverted or not, but at least they should have a temporal end (1-2 months, maybe). Some statistical evaluation of the results once that period is passed ...will be nice. strakhov ([[User talk:Strakhov|talk]]) 19:08, 17 February 2019 (UTC)\n** I do think granular protection would be a far better solution.

The consultation will seek input from as many different parts of the Wikimedia community as possible \u2013 on multiple projects, in multiple languages, and with multiple perspectives \u2013 to come up with a product direction for a set of communication features that a product team will be able to work on in the coming fiscal year.|[[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019]]}}\n\nAn explicit objective of the consultation is to change communication on Wikimedia projects in some way, because the present wikitext communication system [[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019#Purpose of the consultation|effectively forms a cultural barrier for new contributors, in spite of its flexibility and transparency]]. In enumerating various possible outcomes and solutions, the consultation page [[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019#Possible solutions|notes]]: \"For this process to work, we need to be open to all kinds of directions.\"\n\nIn this stage of the consultation, the WMF [[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019#Phase 1: Collect information|suggests asking community members five questions]]. There are therefore five subsections for each of those questions (under [[#Suggested questions|\u00a7 Suggested questions]]).

Nevertheless, most of the important discussion fora (the [[Wikidata:project chat|project chat]], and the other pages listed in {{tl|Discussion navigation}}) are wikitext pages dominated by English speakers, although they do function reasonably well. [[WD:RFC|Requests for comment]] can take an exceptionally long time (sometimes more than a year), and other discussions may not end satisfactorily due to the small number of users; the English Wikipedia, for comparison, invariably and inevitably has many more subject specialists in most areas. Talk pages for items appear to me to be dominated by spammers, and as noted by Jmabel, centralizing discussion is quite helpful considering the contributor\u2013content ratio. A pertinent issue is that Wikidata is also newer than other projects, so many of the community processes may seem incomplete. [[User:Jc86035|Jc86035]] ([[User talk:Jc86035|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 17:51, 23 February 2019 (UTC)\n* Talk pages for individual properties, and talk pages for wikiprojects, are also both forums that are significant and can work well.  And user talk pages of course.  I would like to note that I strongly prefer conventional talk pages to ones using Flow, because of the ability to easily read through previous conversations, and see the development of discussions presented in sequence and in context. [[User:Jheald|Jheald]] ([[User talk:Jheald|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 21:24, 23 February 2019 (UTC)\n*As others have said, Project Chat and talk pages for Projects and Properties seem to work very well.  Good conversations also happen on Property Proposal pages and at [[Wikidata:Request_a_query|Request a Query]]. I also use the Facebook group for off-the-wall questions. - [[User:PKM|PKM]] ([[User talk:PKM|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 23:11, 23 February 2019 (UTC)\n*:Hello [[User:PKM|PKM]], and thank you for your feedback.

Thanks, [[User:Trizek (WMF)|Trizek (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Trizek (WMF)|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 16:41, 13 March 2019 (UTC)\n*::The real-time aspect of Facebook groups and Telegram is crucial - particularly the ability to see a  notification that someone has replied to a conversation on my phone, tablet, or laptop, regard;less of whether I have the application open or not.  With Talk pages, all contributors have to be actively looking at a Wikimedia page to see a notification of a new message. That slows down conversations significantly compared to FB and Telegram. - [[User:PKM|PKM]] ([[User talk:PKM|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:02, 13 March 2019 (UTC)\n* I echo the comments above about Project Chat, the Properties and Project talk pages, property proposal discussions, RFC's,  etc - those are generally working, though could be better. Discussions on item ('Q') talk pages - and I guess now Lexeme ('L') talk pages, almost never seem to be satisfactory. The central problem \"blocking\" progress on Wikidata I think is the difficulty of engaging the right community of users. Adding more pages to Watchlists by default (every time you edit an item?) and encouraging people to regularly check their Watchlists might help; the \"alert\" system when you are pinged right now does work but requires a \"ping\". And the \"ping project\" template is either broken right now or not doing what I would expect, it should be easier to contact the people you need to talk to! [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 14:02, 24 February 2019 (UTC)\n** On en-wiki a workaround for the problem of low-traffic article talk pages is to prominently have templates at the top of the talk page identifying the relevant WikiProjects for the subject.  This gives people somewhere to go, if their initial post on an article talk page gains no response, or if further eyes are needed to break an impasse.  It's not something we've ever I think taken up here.  But perhaps here the expectation is that talk pages for individual Q-items are ''so'' unlikely to be looked at, that a WikiProject talk page or central ProjectChat is known to be the default venue for first response.  Talk pages can be quite useful for reference information like the {{tl|item documentation}} template though.  [[User:Jheald|Jheald]] ([[User talk:Jheald|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 10:22, 28 February 2019 (UTC)\n** I share the sentiment about item talk pages. As a relatively new contributor, I often find it desirable to consult those with knowledge or experience in a particular area (or even just be able to point them towards something that needs attention). Checking the item talk page is probably the first step a newer contributor like myself intuitively takes when seeking discussion/collaboration. Unfortunately right now that doesn't usually produce any valuable direction - my first port of call tends to be the project chat where I hope that someone interested in the same area sees my question. If WikiProjects could be associated to certain items and all instances and sub classes of those had links to the WikiProject on their talk page, I think that would massively improve the ease of collaboration (and discoverability of WikiProjects - I feel that currently you need to go out of your way to find them). --[[User:SilentSpike|SilentSpike]] ([[User talk:SilentSpike|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:32, 30 March 2019 (UTC)\n* Despite some bug, Flow is quite a good tool (no need to know the painfully unuseful wikisyntax, automatic signing and pinging, etc.).

The one thing I see most is that people don't get the thing about signing your post.

As a result, those users might never actually have to interact with wikitext because of the nature of Wikidata content. I suspect Wikidata has a larger proportion of users who don't know how to use wikitext discussions than most other WMF wikis, although I don't really interact with new users much and almost never have to discuss anything with them.

Even if you manually delete vandalism it pushes the thread in which the vandalism was deleted to the top of the history of the talk page. If further resources are invested into Flow (which I would support), a proper roleback feature should be implemented.

Perhaps those are the users we particularly need to be trying to reach for their opinions?

I think it could be ameliorated by sending out a MassMessage, but you would still get an unknown skew of viewpoints because we don't know if talk pages themselves are driving away contributors. Nevertheless, sending out a MassMessage is probably a good idea. [[User:Jc86035|Jc86035]] ([[User talk:Jc86035|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:13, 1 March 2019 (UTC)\n::[[User:Jheald|Jheald]] and [[User:Jc86035|Jc86035]], I share this concern.  The team is making some (mostly small) efforts to geet those missing viewpoints (we're going to get a report from someone doing in-person observations at an edit-a-thon, and if anyone wants to talk to folks on Facebook or Twitter or whatever, that's perfectly fine), but we will be missing a lot.  Most of the announcements are on wiki or in mailing lists for people already well-connected to the movement.\n::If you think it's a good idea, I could try to get an e-mail address created for people who can't post on this page.  Then you could send a MassMessage with \"post here or e-mail there\", if you wanted.  (Please ping me if you want me to look into that possibility.)  It might also be possible to let people reply in Flow on Wikidata, if you think that would reduce the barrier enough.  (I'm not sure whether this wiki's Flow defaults to visual or wikitext modes, so that would get automatic pings about replies for anyone who watches the discussion, but it might not hide wikitext, if that's the main concern.) \n::As a third option, I've talked to the team about using a survey, and if they decide to do that, then that's another thing that could be sent to users that you'd like to hear from.  The biggest thing that I learned from [[mw:VisualEditor/Survey 2015]] is that the commitment to on-wiki communication can be a lot lower than it sounds like.  We got about 500 responses in Qualtrics and just two (2!) on wiki.  I think this set of five questions is better suited for a discussion than for a simple survey.  So perhaps while I've already got your attention, you would consider telling me if you have any ideas about what to ask in such a survey.  I've been toying with questions like \"Is it more important to improve access on mobile devices, or more important to keep things nearly the same?\" (trade-offs and values) or \"Which of the following ways have you used to communicate with other contributors?\" (probably taking the list from [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Tools in use]]).

The users might not have any assurance that their feedback would be received, and they might have to already have problems in mind in order to have something to write; i.e. [[:q:Steve Jobs#1990s|\"people don't know what they want until you show it to them\"]]. Furthermore, they would have to spend time re-stating the same problems that many experienced users have already mentioned.\n::: Since the apparent main purpose of the consultation is to determine which things to improve, I think most of the survey questions would concern prioritization of issues. The discussion which has already occurred on the English Wikipedia (and on other Wikipedias) would be quite helpful in determining what to ask, since many contributors have exhaustively enumerated their problems and feature requests.\n::: Maybe something like a \"how much do you agree with these statements\" 6-point scale page (e.g. \"I have trouble indenting comments\" or \"I find talk pages [intimidating/inscrutable/weird/outdated]\"), and then a text box for respondents to list other issues that weren't mentioned; and then a 6-point scale page for \"how much would you want these improvements to be made\" (e.g. \"use of valid HTML on discussion pages\" or \"inline replies to comments\"), with another text box; and then a 6-point scale page for \"how important are these things to you\" (e.g. \"the ability to view all changes since the last visit to the page\" or \"the use of the same discussion software across all discussion pages\").\n::: I think identity questions would also be useful for analysis, as usual. In addition to [[:m:Learning and Evaluation/Question Bank/Demographics|the standard questions]], I think field of work is something that hasn't been explored much in previous WMF surveys, and it could be important (e.g. in filtering software developers from analysis of how difficult talk pages are to use). Maybe things like gender identity, urban/rural, number of total edits, and number of months active (i.e. at least one edit made to any project) could also be requested.\n::: I personally think that the \"hub-and-spoke\" system was not a very practical idea, even if it might be useful for constructing a survey. Aside from effectively excluding feedback from developers who usually only edit the MediaWiki wiki, users are essentially repeating the same things in each participant group; some users (e.g. myself) have to spend hours setting up groups and asking people to participate; the feedback is almost entirely dependent on the initiative of experienced users willing to put up with this stuff to set up pages on their own wikis; the feedback is ''also'' entirely dependent on [[:c:Commons:Talk pages consultation 2019|having enough users who care about bureaucratic backwaters]]; the suggested questions are annoyingly vague; and [[:w:en:User talk:Iridescent#Talk pages consultation 2019|there is very little assurance that the WMF is actually going to do anything with the feedback]]. (The landing page is also not getting a lot of page views for a global CentralNotice, or at least a large number of active editors are ignoring it and/or haven't bothered to find out what it is.) [[User:Jc86035|Jc86035]] ([[User talk:Jc86035|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 10:02, 4 March 2019 (UTC)\n::::I was reminded today that some previous work found that frequency of editing, rather than total volume, was the better predictor of struggle (at least on Wikipedia).  The general idea is that daily editors (like us) will figure it out and have a lot of practice, but if you're on wiki once a year for Wiki Loves Monuments, or you drop in to fix a hundred typos every few months (the way some people binge-watch television shows), the oddities have to be figured out all over again.\n::::I'm seeing some differences in the different consultations.  This discussion and the one at the German Wikipedia have highlighted the difficulty of getting replies in the Talk: namespace.  The German Wikipedia is concerned about archiving.  (The English Wikipedia should be worried about that, given the mess that happened when we lost the Miszabots a while back, but I don't recall anyone mentioning it.)  Multiple groups have mentioned signing as a problem for less experienced contributors.  The English Wikipedia has talked about accessibility and indentation problems (one of my favorite discussions so far, by the way), but it hasn't really come up at the smaller wikis.  The Chinese Wikipedia \u2013\u00a0I'm not sure that their concerns match anyone else's, actually.  They have a lot more familiarity with Flow (more precisely, with the tiny fraction of Flow that has actually been implemented) on user talk pages, and their contributors haven't been around as long as us, and that really changes the perception.

[[User:Jc86035|Jc86035]] ([[User talk:Jc86035|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:15, 20 May 2019 (UTC)\n\n== Main questions ==\nVery briefly, [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Phase 1 report|the proposed direction]] is that wikitext talk pages should be improved, and not replaced. We propose building a new design on top of talk pages that changes the page's default appearance, and offers key tools like replying, indenting and signing posts. To keep consistency with existing tools, the new design will be a default experience that existing users can opt out of. We also propose building features that experienced contributors want, including the ability to watchlist a single discussion, and the ability to move, archive and search for threads. Building these features may require some loss of flexibility, or small-to-medium changes in wikitext conventions. The goal is to only make changes that directly enable functionality that users really want.\n\n=== What do you think of the proposed product direction? ===\n:''Context'': The Wikimedia Foundation [[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Phase 1 report#Proposed_product_direction|proposes]] building a new, clearer design on top of existing wikitext talk pages. It will offer simpler tools for replying, indentation and signatures. You could continue to use wikitext on talk pages, if you prefer that.  It should also be possible to participate in a discussion without using wikitext.\n\n:''Question'': What do you think of this product direction?\n* I've already made comments on the English Wikipedia, so I don't have anything to add in this section. [[User:Jc86035|Jc86035]] ([[User talk:Jc86035|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:13, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\n* This proposal sounds great - best of both worlds. Can it actually be done? I guess I'd like to see a demo, and what compromises end up being needed... [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:47, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\n*: {{re|ArthurPSmith}} No code has been written yet and there are no mock-ups, but I'm guessing it would look something like Reddit's new interface mixed with Flow. [[User:Jc86035|Jc86035]] ([[User talk:Jc86035|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:49, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\n*Cool. I am inclined to see a demo. But it will take a while. Sincerely,    [[User:Masumrezarock100|<u><i style=\"color:#087643;font-face:arial;font-weight:bold;text-shadow:gray 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em;\">Masum Reza</i></u>]][[User_talk:Masumrezarock100|<sup style=\"color:orange;\">\u260e</sup>]] 15:36, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\n* A design \"on top of existing wikitext pages\" is a pretty disappointing prospect, to be honest. If \"replying, indentation and signatures\" need to be improved, which I do not have any doubts about, then all of this should be handled by the software exclusively, without the possibility of interferences by users. Yes, this would break existing workflows much more than anything on top of wikitext pages, but otherwise we will not even remotely come close to a \"discussion board\" feeling for newbies. The proposed direction also offeres a lot of potential for mis-use of the new talk pages, either by mistake or intentionally, or because users do not want to or cannot adapt required new workflows. I have hoped for a more Flow-like approach which in many senses provides solutions to the identified core problems, and I do not think that the herein proposed direction is a good idea. \u2014[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:21, 25 May 2019 (UTC)\n** I caution against putting a halo around \"newbies\". I was listening to an interview with Rodney Brooks the other day, and he brought up Marvin Minsky's category of \"suitcase words\". I tend to supplement this concept with \"trombone words\", where the depth of the intended sense is highly variable, yet customarily unstated. This goes along with my long-standing habit of <code>s/simple/simple for whom?/g</code> (that is vim editor syntax for globally replacing every instance of the word \"simple\" with the question \"simple for ''whom''?\" everywhere and always). The trombone-word analog is \"newbie at ''what''?\". There are many, many different domains of horizontal skill transfer. These days, the world of youthful energy consists almost entirely of digital natives. Yet \"newbies\" continue to abound, moving the definitional yardsticks by means of the AI shuffle (rule: as soon as a computer can do, it no longer counts as AI). The underlying problem is that we're stuck with an impedance mismatch somewhere: the rules concerning what constitutes a valid citation, and how that citation is best employed are simply not \"normal\" in the real world. Wikipedia is also somewhat of a Klingon conlang in its underlying rules of social consensus. These are the two fundamental skills a \"newbie\" must eventually master to become a Wikipedia native. (The syntax is no worse than coping with stave notation for the first time, after you've already learned to play an instrument competently by ear; the Internet abounds with unreliable stories about which famous musicians can and can not read sheet music, and in what settings, to what end.) One possible perspective on this is the greedy algorithm: if we keep beating down the worst thing\u2014in any reasonable order\u2014the impedance mismatch will someday diminished or disappear. But I don't think this is true. The core cultural impedance mismatches between all things Wikipedia and all things ''not'' Wikipedia strike me as quite robust. So sure, we can spit-shine the welcome mat with an integrated discussion system that breaks existing workflows, but to what end? When I listen to French CBC on my radio (I have only a smattering of French) there's a limit to how much pristine radio reception abets my comprehension (it does help, but only marginally). Social is not the core product of Wikipedia. There's more involved in maintaining a viable community than creating a comfort zone for that first horrible day in boot camp. Moreover, the people who are going to stick in out in an encyclopedia culture are not your grandmother's newbies. Are they scholarship newbies? If so, they're going to struggle with the citation ground game. Are they formal-syntax newbies? If so, they're running against the grain of automation culture found in all domains IT. Are they collaborative project newbies? Then they're going to run aground on issues of ownership, prerogative, and authority. Are they seat-of-the-pants RTFM newbies? Then they're not going to enjoy being dunned by \"per MOS\" (or any other formal guideline). People who are rarely newbies at ''any'' of these things: white middle-aged male software engineers (I am, of course, one such person). So it's reasonable to think we can \"solve\" the inclusion problem by making Wikipedia slick and cuddly like an iPhone. And indeed, these devices are slick and cuddly now, and these days everyone ''is'' on social media, and sensible people are now wondering out loud whether the world as we knew it will ever recover. I personally don't see the wisdom of kicking incrementalism in the can (the aforementioned workflows), just to kick the impedance mismatch can further down the road\u2014out of some blind faith in \"social\" when social in the large remains something of a shit show on its own terms (were it not so, but it is). Certainly there are many Stevie Wonders out there, and you want to bring these people into the fold as smoothly as possible, but at the same time, Wikipedia is fundamentally a sheet-music culture, and will remain so for at least a decade to come. From where I sit, re-inventing the talk pages as a fluid jam session completely misses this point. [[Special:Contributions/70.67.182.26|70.67.182.26]] 22:26, 29 May 2019 (UTC)\n* Two things: 1. The \"proposed direction\" page seems to consider indentation and mobile use as two separate issues, whereas the main issue on mobile is that after the fourth indentation or so you have about one character per line. 2. A problem with Flow specific to Wikidata is the handling of localized models in non-English talk pages (for example, on the [[Wikidata:Bistro|French Bistro]], typing <nowiki>{{Q|3}}</nowiki> will display \"life (Q3)\" instead of \"vie (Q3)\". How does the planned model solves that issue? -[[User:Ash Crow|Ash Crow]] ([[User talk:Ash Crow|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:57, 31 May 2019 (UTC)\n* On Wikidata we have with our property proposal system, a case where we use Wikitext but it's still possible to follow individual property proposals and be notified when those change. Maybe, it's good to have a similar system for the individual discussions on talk pages that better supported by software to make it easier to use. [[User:ChristianKl|<font color=\"#0000EE\">'''ChristianKl'''</font>]] \u276a[[User talk:ChristianKl|\u2709]]\u276b 13:40, 7 June 2019 (UTC)\n\n=== Marking separate discussions ===\n:''Context'': People want to watch individual sections on the talk page.  They want better notifications, archiving, and search.  To do any of this, we may need to create a more structured definition of what counts as a single discussion. This may mean making changes to the wikitext conventions on a talk page. For example, we may create a new way that discussion headings look in wikitext, or a new link that you need to use to create, rename or split a thread.\n\n:''Question'': What are the pros and cons of that approach?\n* I assume this would function only at the \"top\" level within a given page, there wouldn't be support for subheadings etc? I suppose this is fine though. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:53, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\n* I don't think this works as long as users can manipulate the \"structured definition of what counts as a single discussion\". Sounds fragile as hell. \u2014[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:24, 25 May 2019 (UTC)\n\n=== Helping newcomers find the talk pages ===\n:''Context'':  Newcomers have difficulty finding talk pages.  During user tests, only one person out of ten found the {{Int:talk}} tab. Most testers looked for a {{Int:talk}} tab on the opposite side of the page, where all of the other tabs and links are. Many people also expected to see links to discussions about specific sections in the article. We may want to move the link to the talk page to the opposite side of the article page.  We might add discussion functionality connected to individual sections.\n\n:''Question'': What are the pros and cons of making the connection between article content and discussions more visible?\n* What about putting a link to discussion in the nav bar on the left-hand side of the page? But in general making the connection more visible sounds good. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:56, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\n* This is rather simple UI stuff, not much related to the rest of the consultation. Maybe some UI testing with different link positions and link texts (e.g. \"discuss this article\" rather than \"Discussion\") would help to identify simple and effective improvements. It might also be worth to consider different skins, particularly the modern Timeless skin, during research\u2014do they work better out of the box than the dated Vector/Monobook skins? \u2014[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:28, 25 May 2019 (UTC)\n* Personally, I'm happy the way it is.  Giving more prominence to a tab that the thoughtful can find relatively easily runs the risk of encouraging unfocused posts, blogging, soapboxing to the extent that Wikipedia could become seen as a discussion forum. [[User:Dreamwoven|Dreamwoven]] ([[User talk:Dreamwoven|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:40, 28 May 2019 (UTC)\n\n=== Where to show discussion tools ===\n:''Context'':  Currently, many wikis have community discussion spaces in the project namespace (<code>{{Ns:4}}:</code> or <code>Wikipedia:</code>), rather than in a talk namespace (<code>{{Ns:5}}:</code> or <code>Wikipedia talk:</code>). The project namespace is often used for village pumps/caf\u00e9s, noticeboards, and some workflows, such as [[W:en:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for deletion]]. The system will need to know where discussions happen, so that it can display the new tools in those discussions, and not display them on other pages. There are several potential ways to do this. One of them is to move all discussions to a talk namespace.\n\n:''Question'': What are the pros and cons of doing that?\n* NOOOO! This doesn't seem a good fit for Wikidata at least. We have a ton of pages that are basically structured discussions - property proposals for example. On the other hand there's not much point in having a \"discussion\" page for a discussion like that (maybe to discuss something at a meta level as we do with RFC's?). So if there could be a setting, maybe a template or something that designates a page as \"discussion only\", that might be useful - then there's no \"Project page\"/\"Discussion\" dichotomy, it's just a \"project discussion\" page. Another concern with this proposal relates to new users - if they have trouble finding discussion pages, won't they have even more trouble if every discussion is moved to the \"Talk\" namespace?  [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:01, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\n* The proposed \"discussion mode\" should be possible in any namespace, not only those which end with \"talk\". I would prefer a toggle switch in the \"page information\" section that is accessible for project admins, akin to \"Page content language\" or \"Page content model\". The \"discussion mode\" could by default be enabled in all \"talk\" namespaces and disabled in all other namespaces so that only a few exceptions would need to be set up manually by project admins. However, it would be desirable if the talk pages had a clearly different appearance from content pages. (Important for Wikipedias, but not that much for Wikidata which does not really have wikitext content pages.) \u2014[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:35, 25 May 2019 (UTC)\n\n=== History tradeoffs ===\n:''Context'':  Sometimes, you need to see the history of the entire page.  Other times, it would be more helpful to see the history of only a single discussion thread. It would be ideal if we could provide both, but we're not sure how to do that.\n\n:''Question'': What are the pros and cons of having a complete page history or a specific thread history?\n* The problem with complete page history is everything is jumbled together, it gets hard to find what you are looking for. History for a single thread would be fine. However, there also needs to be some sort of history regarding the page as a whole - when discussions were added to it or removed from it and by who for instance? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:03, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\n* I am only interested in the most recent page and/or discussion history, say the past day or so, to watch discussions and deal with vandalism. For more dated contributions, I rely on signatures only, thus I do not really care about page/discussion histories. However, If there needs to be a trade-off between those two, I weakly prefer discussion histories over page histories. \u2014[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:41, 25 May 2019 (UTC)\n\n=== Metadata location ===\n:''Context'':  Some wikis place templates at the top of article talk pages.  These may show instructions, warnings, or FAQs.  They may hold page quality information, link to relevant WikiProjects, or identify past activities.  Many new users are confused by finding non-discussion material at the top of an article talk page.  It would be helpful to move some or all of that content somewhere else on the page, or under a different tab.\n\n:''Question'': What are the pros and cons of that approach? Which templates are crucial for the proper use of a discussion page, and which could be moved somewhere else?\n* Wikidata is one of those wikis that uses talk page metadata templates. It probably wouldn't be harmful if those had to be moved (unless the content model changes), particularly since most of those templates' content is automatically generated. However, the phase 1 report makes clear that change for change's sake would be undesirable, so for Wikidata this really depends on whether it's acceptable to cause some disruption and force some templates and Lua modules to be modified. [[User:Jc86035|Jc86035]] ([[User talk:Jc86035|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:18, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\n* The Status Quo is a consequence of the current talk page mess. I would be glad if that could be resolved as well, but I am not sure where it should go. A separate \"meta\" section on the talk page could be helpful, but many projects could consequently need a \"meta\" section on actual content pages as well (English Wikipedia WikiProject banners manage the content, but they are not related to the talk pages where they are placed). So: yes please, tidy this mess as well. \u2014[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:56, 25 May 2019 (UTC)\n\n== Other discussions ==\nBased on [[:mw:Talk:Talk pages consultation 2019/Phase 1 report#Other discussions|this discussion]], I believe it would be appropriate for participants (including unregistered users) to create new subsections here if they believe that those discussions would be useful in any way to the WMF team.

In the context of Wikidata editing, data schemas can provide a standardised structure for data on a subject area. For example, all the items on museums would use the same structure to describe basic facts about them like location, collection type, date opened etc. \n\nThere are many existing schemas available online which apply to different kinds of data about the world, e.g. [https://schema.org schema.org].\n\n[[Wikidata:WikiProject Schemas|Wikidata Schemas]] have recently been released on Wikidata. This provides the technical means for recording the schemas for different subject areas, but requires advanced technical knowledge to create and currently have limited documentation. They also do not include any kind of process for discussion or consensus for creating schemas. \n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|[[File:Noun Project problems icon 2417098.svg|75px]]\n|\n===Problem statement===\nThere is currently no place for the community to propose, or \"agree\" on the correct model for specific types of items (e.g. a train, plant, human author, human astronaut etc).\n\nNow that Wikidata Schemas have been implemented, we have a place that can represent the model at a technical level (e.g. [[EntitySchema:E10]] for a human). But without a community driven discussion and creation process the models will not be used as the \"consensus\".\n\nThis inevitably leads to all of the issues associated with data inconsistency, which Wikidata editors and third party re-users need to find a way to work around. A few of the main issues are listed below:\n\n====Difficult to query====\nInconsistent data modelling means that it's much harder to find, add and query. E.g the location for museums is modelled in at least three ways on Wikidata:\n\n# Using the statement 'coordinate location'\n# As a qualifier for in the statement headquarters\n# As 'coordinate location' for the building the museum is housed in, with another item for the legal entity\n\nThese were the ones found, but there may be others. This variation in the way different items records the same data means it is very difficult to work with the data, to trust that a query is returning all the information Wikidata has on that subject and to reuse data from Wikidata on other Wikimedia projects.\n\n====Repeated mistakes====\nThere is also no way to collate subject specific knowledge on how data of a kind should be modelled to reflect the data accurately and so editors can't see how to correctly model it. E.g Many World Heritage sites include multiple buildings, some include 100s of listed buildings. Different editors have repeatedly added 'Heritage status = World Heritage site' to all the buildings inside a World Heritage site, which is incorrect. This leads queries on World Heritage sites being completely wrong, showing 100s of World Heritage sites in a single city.  \n\n==== Impedes third party re-use ====\nThere is a general lack of confidence that data will remain intact after a donation from third party, or when simply reusing the data in another application. As there is no location to put a stamp of approval on a particular way to model something it's much more difficult to have faith that it will not change (or that you even know where to look if you find it is changing).  \n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|[[File:Community Noun project 26481.svg|75px]]\n|\n\n===Benefits of having community agreed data schemas on Wikidata===\nSome of the major benefits of a more unified approach with community agreed schemas are:\n====Data quality====\n* Increases data quality and data completeness by allowing people to find and use the most appropriate schema for the subject.\n* Provides data that could be used to improve the \u2018property suggester\u2019 tool (statements which are part of the schema could be used as the highest priority suggestions).\n\n====Usability====\n* Make data easier to find and use, including being able to have simpler and more consistent queries.\n* Could be used by query tools like [https://prowd-prototype.herokuapp.com ProWD] to understand data completeness.\n*Easier to build third party applications using Wikidata, as expected models would be easy to find\n\n====Community growth and health====\n* Help people learn Wikidata more easily by having clear instructions to follow.\n* Reduce arguments and increase community health by having clear rules on data structure that everyone can follow.\n* An item creation wizard could be created based on the schema for that topic.\n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|[[File:Noun project drafting icon 1446749 cc.svg|75px]]\n|\n\n===Existing work on data schemas on Wikidata===\n*[[Wikidata talk:WikiProject ShEx|Wikidata schemas]] allow you to define models for any desired type/grouping of items, e.g. [[EntitySchema:E10|E10]] is the schema for a human.\n**Any community agreed schema should ideally be converted into ShEx code as soon as possible. \n**They are written using the ShEx (\"Shape Expressions\") language. Shape Expressions are extremely flexible, allowing you to define very precise (or very broad!) conditions that the data should meet, as well as complex conditional requirements (e.g. a human item '''may''' ''or'' '''may not''' have a 'date of death', but if it does have one, then it '''must''' have a 'date of birth' statement as well).\n**Because of the complexity of learning the ShEx language general non-technical Wikidata editors will not be able to write or edit Wikidata Schemas.\n**Once created, they can be used to do automated checking and reporting on Wikidata items. This could give you a report on what needs to be fixed, or just a completeness score for example.\n*[[toolforge:wikidata-todo/cradle/#/|Cradle]] allows people to create schemas, however they are created by one user and the schema is recorded on [[Wikidata:Cradle]]. These schemas could be used as starting points for community discussions to agrees schemas.\n* [[Wikidata:Model items|Model items]] and [[Wikidata:Showcase items|showcase items]] both present best practice for describing a subject but do not explicitly describe what to include and are not include a defined schema e.g Douglas Adams is a model item for a person but few of the statements for Douglas Adams are applicable to people in different professions. \n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n\n----\n\n\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n<center>[[File:Noun Project scheme icon 118318.svg|100px]]</center><p><center><big>'''Data schemas on Wikidata'''</big></center>\n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|[[File:Noun Project icon for central 2874901.svg|75px]]\n|\n\n==A central place to discuss and create data schemas collaboratively==\nA central discussion area, similar to [[Wikidata:Property proposal]] but for proposing and collaborating to develop Wikidata Schemas. 'Wikidata:Schema Requests' could use [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Meta:FormWizard FormWizard] and Visual Editor to lower the barriers to participation. This central proposal area should allow subject experts to develop schemas without requiring a deep level of technical knowledge. The schemas, once agreed, would then be recorded in Shape Expressions by people who have the technical knowledge.\nAfter a new Wikidata Schema has been created, the \"proposal discussion\" would be linked on its talk page (or transcluded into the page). All future discussion about the model will continue on the talk page, with the original proposal being archived.\nNote: There are many ways in which the community could ''present'' the model that they have all agreed to. For example, we could use Wiki tables, or templates to show lists of expected Wikidata statements, or simply a list of bullet points initially. If the proposal here is agreed, there can be plenty of subsequent discussion about the best way to communicate the human generated plan.\n\n<br />\n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|[[File:Noun Project icon for capture 2572182.svg|75px]]\n|\n\n==Recording agreed data schemas==\nModels decided by the community would be recorded as new Wikidata Schemas (e.g. [[EntitySchema:E10|E10]] for human) by editors who know how to write Shape Expressions. \n\nThe schema would then be linked to the corresponding Wikidata item for that class by a statement on the Wikidata item (e.g.{{Statement|Q5|--> Wikidata Schema -->|E10||}}). So all items with{{Statement||P31|Q5||}} should comply with this schema.\n\n''Note: The required property has [[Wikidata:Property proposal/Generic#Shape Expression for class|already been proposed]], but is on hold waiting for [[phab:T225701|this Phabricator ticket]], which will allow Wikidata Schemas to be used in statements''\n\nWe ultimately need some kind of link between individual ''instances'' and the Wikidata Schema that should be used to describe them. However, this would have to be in the form of User Interface enhancements to implement in the future. For example, when someone is editing {{Q|Q42}}, it would make perfect sense to prompt the user that they should be using the schema for a \"human\", or have a button to check what's missing/complete. This is just an example solution, but it's included here to emphasise the end goal of Wikidata Schemas informing editors about community agreed models.\n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|[[File:Noun project Search icon 151781 000000.svg|75px]]\n|\n\n==Ways of finding and exploring Wikidata data schemas==\nThe following are some suggested methods to encourage greater use and discoverability of Wikidata Schemas:\n\n*A statement for 'Wikidata schema' added to the Wikidata item for the subject that links to the Shape Expression (e.g. {{Q|5}} links to and from [[EntitySchema:E10|E10]]).\n* An equivalent of [[Wikidata:List of properties]] for schemas to be able to explore and search for schemas.\n* Some way of exploring how items in the same class relate to each other e.g the schema for humans and the schema for writers.\n* Show how far up the class tree the schema exists e.g the schema for a person would not include information about the taxonomic tree.\n* Some way to show the schema for the item class on each item page in that class, e.g a template on the talk page which was added by a bot to show the schemas for that class eg author. A longer term version of this could be a 'completeness' scale for the item based on its schemas, and even a schema tab on each item.\n* Linking from Shape Expressions to Wikiprojects and vice versa to better involve relevant community groups in schema creation.\n*Item creation Wizards? e.g. Use the schema for an Author to create a [[toolforge:wikidata-todo/cradle/#/|Cradle]] style form for making new Authors.\n\n\nNote: There are already many discussions underway for exciting new ways to view and interact with ShEx Wikidata Shemas in a visual way, but these are all really a subject for future discussion. The important point to realise is that Schema pages will likely be human friendly places to visit once the initial run of experimentation and tool development runs its course.\n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|[[File:Noun Project question mark bubble icon 1328413 cc.svg|75px]]\n|\n\n==Outstanding questions==\n\n* Where exactly should the proposal area be?  Maybe at [[Wikidata:Schema proposal]]?\n*What format should the community discussed, non technical schemas be presented in when ready for a Shape Expression? Could we just use existing templates (e.g. [[Template:Statement+|Statement+]]), or Tables in Visual Editor?\n*How could you define the most wanted or most valued statements in a schema? Maybe just 3 groups, \"must have\", \"should have\", \"would be nice\"?\n\n* How to capture agreement on granularity of items? E.g a museum as one item or as two items, the building and the legal entity\n\n* Where do we draw the line from one model to the next? ShEx allows you to extend any model to include expectations about the items that are linked (e.g. museum should have a location, but that location should also have coordinates). It would seem logical that we do '''not''' extend beyond the model's boundaries. Other connected item should have its own model to follow.\n|-\n|}"

With this change, VIAF would go more or less last, unless treated specially (which would probably be confusing). [[User:Ghouston|Ghouston]] ([[User talk:Ghouston|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:31, 30 December 2019 (UTC)\n* {{support}} I perfectly agree about the proposal of sorting identifiers in some way, in order to make it easier to find them. At the moment the sorting of all properties is managed through [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]], {{ping|ArthurPSmith}}; the only identifier which is sorted at the moment is {{P|214}}, which is set to appear first, {{ping|Ghouston}}, as a result of [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/Sort identifier statements on items that are instances of human|this RFC]] which has just closed (to be more precise: the RFC resulted in a consensus to have VIAF as first identifier on human items; however, Wikibase-SortedProperties doesn't have the possibility to restrict a sorting to a class of items at the moment, so I had to enforce the sorting on all items).\n: I agree with the proposal of setting first the most important identifiers and then others in alphabetical order; it can be considered the possibility of establishing an alphabetical order between topic-groups of identifiers (e.g. all cinema identifiers sorted alphabetically between them, then all music identifiers sorted alphabetically between them, then etc.). The most important task is, firstly, establishing which are the ''most important identifiers'', which should go first. I think two criteria should be considered: how many times a property is used and how diverse are the items where it is used. Looking at [[Wikidata:Database reports/List of properties/Top100]] (update six months ago), the most widely used identifier is {{P|698}}; however, it is used only in scientific articles items, so in my opinion it shouldn't go first; similar cases of sectorial identifiers are, in that list, {{P|932}}, {{P|5875}}, {{P|846}}, {{P|2326}}, {{P|830}}, {{P|351}}, {{P|5055}}, {{P|352}}, {{P|3382}}, {{P|590}}, {{P|3151}}, {{P|815}}, {{P|637}}, in some sense also {{P|345}}); in conclusion, the most widely used and \"universal\" identifiers seem to be, in this order, {{P|356}}, {{P|1566}}, {{P|214}}, {{P|646}}, {{P|244}}, {{P|213}}, {{P|227}}. However, there is a problem: this list has been updated six months ago and it takes into account all uses of the identifiers (not only as main value, but also as qualifiers and references), so it is not completely fit to our scope.\n: Given all these premises, I would suggest to proceed in the following way: finding an updated statistic of all identifiers which have more than 500k (or 100k, as preferred) uses as main value; choosing, from that list, only the identifiers which are used on a wide range of items, not only in a restricted sector; sorting the choosed identifiers to make them appear always first; then start reflecting on the sorting of other identifiers, evaluating the possibility of sorting them alphabetically according to topic-groups. --[[User:Ep\u00ecdosis|'''Ep\u00ec''']][[User talk:Ep\u00ecdosis|<span style=\"color:green\">'''dosis'''</span>]] 12:25, 31 December 2019 (UTC)\n* {{support}} While teaching Wikidata, I have to stress to the students that the sorting of the IDs section is quite \"random\" and I don't like that.

Presumably it would be sufficient to re-order properties something like once a week or once a month. In any case, it's not clear if it would be appropriate to edit the page automatically, since such edits would require a bot with administrator permissions.

[[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:54, 28 February 2020 (UTC)\n* Please apply any type of sorting as soon as possible, in order to have items with so many identifiers comparable. It is not actually important what type of sorting we have, currently there is no any and that is a shame for Wikidata that promises structured and not mixed up data.\n:And btw, please link somehow pencil link in Authority control and Official website templates on Wikipedia lead to Identifiers and Official website identifier/property if possible for the latter (if not then that one too to identifiers section because it is there where is website located, AC elements of course all are in Identifiers section and currently pencil just leads us to item on Wikidata and hover text says edit on Wikidata but one cannot immediately find it to edit it here). --[[User:Obsuser|Obsuser]] ([[User talk:Obsuser|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:17, 28 February 2020 (UTC)\n* I have adjusted your interpretations of my comments, I did '''not''' advocate for alphabetical sorting, and in fact I '''opposed''' it, but your interpretation said that I supported it. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:55, 28 February 2020 (UTC)\n* Than you for the summary...

This solution could be the default, meaning that identifiers could also be managed on a user basis, like the Babel template filters and sorts languages. E.g.: &#123;&#123;IDs:P214|P213|P5379|P5371&#125;&#125;, or even &#123;&#123;IDs:P214|P213|P5379|P5371|others&#125;&#125;, where \"others\" are ordered by P number.

In any case if we need a fixed order this way, let's just assume we will also create a help page with the rationale linked from the general pages describing IDs and there we define a clear discussion talk page where we can monitor the situation and if other technical solution remain challenging, we can propose slight changes over the time. This aspect has a decent impact but it's a very technical topic, I don't expect cluttering, just a dozen users who really care who will discuss small adjustements once in a while.--[[User:Alexmar983|Alexmar983]] ([[User talk:Alexmar983|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:48, 2 March 2020 (UTC)\n* {{s}}. I would agree with Moebeus's point about adding P1827, P1243 and P1828 before the alphabetical identifiers; however, I think it would also be pertinent to identify similarly important identifiers in other areas and gradually add them in that section of the list. It could be appropriate for us to determine specific criteria for selecting such identifiers, and for determining what to do if there are lots of dominant identifiers in a particular field. [[User:Jc86035|Jc86035]] ([[User talk:Jc86035|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:56, 2 March 2020 (UTC)\n::besides adding some geenric obvious guideline about taking into account massive cross-use as IDs or as sources or as authority control on local projects, we could allow a voting phase as a final passage... it's not perfect but a threshold of \"at least X users supporting the insertion above the alphabetical order with less than X% opposing\" is not elegant but more or less should work. This should also encourages to inform projects about it and share more and more different scenarios among us. I am actually interested to discover more point of views on the best possible order, fixing the first part of this list is obviously an interative process if we cannot adopt any other \"formal\" method--[[User:Alexmar983|Alexmar983]] ([[User talk:Alexmar983|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 00:26, 3 March 2020 (UTC)\n* {{comment}} What is the reason for giving priority to {{P|212}}, {{P|957}}, and {{P|236}}? In most instances where these values appear, they are either on the wrong data item, or appear with at most one or two other identifiers.  So either we're emphasizing incorrectly placed data, or applying a data sort that will have almost no utility. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:10, 2 March 2020 (UTC)\n*:Looking at {{P|236}} I cannot see particular reasons for concern about wrong data, while the problem seems more serious for {{P|212}} and {{P|957}}, which are actually often misused in work-items. So, in my opinion the importance of one identifier isn't spoilt by the fact it's often misused (e.g. I would like to have {{P|214}} first even if it had 1M misuses; and ISBN is clearly the most important identifier for book editions, obviously from the 20th century), moreover the modification of the order would be less noted if the number of identifiers present in the items is small and this modification could make the problem of misuses more evident, prompting a discussion about possible solutions; in conclusion, I complessively think that this ordering would be positive, but if other users too think that evidentiating {{P|212}} and {{P|957}} would be bad, we can strip them out ('''proposal 1bis'''). --[[User:Ep\u00ecdosis|'''Ep\u00ec''']][[User talk:Ep\u00ecdosis|<span style=\"color:green\">'''dosis'''</span>]] 21:24, 2 March 2020 (UTC)\n*:: On Mediawiki we have a long history of people seeing something done, assuming it's correct, and copying the same to multiple other pages or items.  If we promote the ISBN identifiers, which are more often wrong than right, then we promote error in our dataset.

There are cases where the newer item has a better definition, almost all sitelinks, and all backlinks. In that case, it does not help to merge into the older item, as all the backlinks would have to be corrected as well. ---[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 10:55, 13 May 2020 (UTC)\n*:What backlinks? Bots fix redirects and sitelinks and as you say \"better definitions\" are transferred during merge. It completely goes against ID stability to merge to newer ones - it can happen endlessly because newer IDs can be created at any time. If someone created a duplicate then this should not be honored. On top of it, vandals can abuse it. How would one control if a merge to a later ID was one under \"good reasons\". The older an ID is, the more incoming ''external'' links it will have ceteris paribus.

For example if the newer ID item is used widely on a large number (hundreds?) of \"large\" items, those edits to fix the redirect can cause a backlog in WDQS synchronization. Also I don't know what you mean about \"better definitions\" being transferred during merge - if there's no definition already then yes the other definition is merged in, but if there's an existing definition than a possibly \"better\" one might be lost. Anyway, most of this is pretty exceptional and I do agree that in the vast majority of cases merging into the older entity is better.

If not complete disabling, merging into newer entity should at least be more difficult (e.g. requiring two clicks), so that the user has to reflect if it is ''really'' the best solution and doesn't do it without much reflection. --[[User:Ep\u00ecdosis|'''Ep\u00ec''']][[User talk:Ep\u00ecdosis|<span style=\"color:green\">'''dosis'''</span>]] 15:35, 18 May 2020 (UTC)\n\n* {{strong oppose}} In ''most'' cases it is sensible to merge into the newer entity. But sometimes it can be counterproductive, and it is very important that we retain the ability to keep the newer ID. For example, {{Q|Q16707842}} (heavily linked and coded into many queries) was discovered to be the same as {{Q|Q11765029}} (not used at all except for one sitelink). A merge from the newer into the older item would break all the existing queries and reports (which would have to be tracked down and fixed off-wiki), and meant that large numbers of links would become redirects needing fixed.\n: As a result, a merge from the older into the newer item had none of these negative impacts, but a hard \"must always merge to the older ID\" would have meant hours of completely unnecessary work to fix things, and links to queries would have stopped working indefinitely. I don't see the benefit to prohibiting it.

So, I'd only support a \"paid editing policy\" that explicitly requires full disclosure; in other words: what is required by the WMF ToU anyways. ---[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 12:24, 16 October 2020 (UTC)\n* I created a draft for a disclosure policy that basically reaffirms the terms of use: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:ChristianKl/Draft:Disclosure_of_paid_editing while adding the opportunity to do disclosure via Wikiproject given that this is another channel of our communication on Wikidata. {{re|MisterSynergy|Dr.\u00fcsenfieber|Pyfisch|Olaf Kosinsky|Ajraddatz}} Any feedback for the draft?

Since many items are within the scope of multiple WikiProjects it is unclear where to look for a disclosure.  The disclosure could be useful to a) find out if a given contribution was paid for b) monitoring activity by paid users for promotional content c) contacting users working at GLAM or other companies to discuss cooperation and other matters. But your proposal doesn't to make this easy.

Part of what I do is edit Wikidata. I am happy to disclose.\n**I look at OpenStreetMap and see huge volunteer community encroachment by paid editors. I predict the same will happen to Wikidata. I think Wikidata needs some policy in place to prevent corporate capture of the sort that OpenStreetMap experienced. Wikidata is much more susceptible to commercial takeover than Wikipedia because contributors are relatively fewer and business editors have much more financial backing.\n**I have no idea what kinds of conflicts Wikidata currently experiences with commercial editors.\n**I wish to avoid or prevent unclear or miscommunication that English Wikipedia and others have had in this space. In my opinion, \"paid editing\" is a poor choice of term, because it conflates editing to share general knowledge from a library or university with editing to do marketing and promotion for public relations. To me these are different enough to merit different terms, but the custom in English Wikipedia is that too often, paid university librarians get grouped as \"paid editors\" along with sleazy marketers, when I think we should lower barriers of access for librarians but raise barriers of access for marketers. I prefer some term like \"paid promotion\" versus \"sponsored editing\", where both perform disclosure but otherwise have different expectations.\n:Thanks for starting the discussion.

I see a few dangers: Wikidata repeating English Wikipedia mistakes and adopting long-term ineffective paid editing policy which wastes volunteer labor hours, the OpenStreetMap example of paid editors claiming equality with volunteers to the benefit of business interests, and the Wikimedia Foundation's worrying understatement of the [[:meta:Okapi]] project to sell Wikidata and Wikimedia content through a WMF-owned commercial company. Details on Okapi are sparse, but the rumor is that the WMF will sell data for US$20 million / year, which I feel is part of a WMF plan to encourage OSM-style commercialization and corporate participation. Information is lacking and again, Wikidata does not currently have problems, but I feel strongly about Wikidata remaining volunteer-oriented and volunteer governed. After the volunteers I want to let in academics, including paid university researchers like me. Beyond volunteers and academics there is an ecosystem of players who want to pay a lot of money to Okapi, and if and when Wikidata becomes commercialized, I advocate for strong barriers and no assumption of good faith from commercial players who will definitely have motivations unlike the volunteer friendly environment we have now. I am very comfortable with librarians getting one rule set and professionals in the corporate world getting a more restrictive one.

When we say a painting was created by \"anonymous\" and another painting was created by \"anonymous\", we end up with a curious result that \"anonymous\" created thousands of paintings and other works of art throughout all of human history...but it seems like an issue that queriers in visual arts community already know how to deal with. If someone was querying for prolific painters in the 16th century, they would know to filter items created by an anonymous creator; alternatively, if they wanted to find examples of unattributed 16th century painters, the anonymous value would be useful (people who work on the topic of forgery and attribution would, I think, want to find a list of paintings that have anonymous creators).

Imagine you want to know which author has created the most work in Wikidata. There is chances this author is \u00ab anonymous \u00bb in a naive query. Of course it\u2019s not exactly fair to the other ones as we intend the property \u00ab author \u00bb to refer to a distinct human, and not a value like \u00ab some human who did not gave its name \u00bb.

The use of an \u00ab anonymous \u00bb value in common databases is on-contrary very often a work-around against the non-availability of a special value like {{unknown value}}. We should also note that of course common databases like authority do not deal with anonymous authors with a common \u00ab anonymous \u00bb item : they have <u>several</u> anonymous. For example the BNF in France : https://data.bnf.fr/fr/search?term=anonyme with one of them https://data.bnf.fr/fr/17821400/anonyme/ : note that this anonymous has its own id : 17821400 .

The practice for thousands of papers is to record authority information on paper and not computers. If you like that practice it makes sense to continue with the paper. Recording information in linked data means that computers can interact in new ways with data and you can run queries instead of doing certain research by hand. Humans who interact with a piece of paper in which \"author:anonymous\" is written are not going to think that they are dealing with a human who's named anonymous. A human who reads information is able to make this distinction that the word anonymous is no human. When you tell a computer that anonymous is a human like Wikidata is currently, the computer is going to trust that anonymous is a human which is silly.

First of all, most paintings from the 17th-century that still survive today have been attributed in the past to multiple people, including anonymous. Often the \"anonymous\" used in older texts (so from the 17th century onwards) do refer to period artists, and sometimes (from the 18th century onwards) they refer to later good faith copyists, often genteel women or paid copyists, who made copies for use in personal chapels or decoration of new buildings. Given this background, some later misattributions were done naively, and some were bad faith attributions to hide the painting in plain sight (e.g. during post-WWII sales of stolen Jewish art). In each case where it is known and documented, I add all attributions and use \"preferred\" for the one in use most recently, and \"deprecated\" for ones rejected. For what are most commonly called \"doubtful\" in catalogs, I will use what the holding institution says, and otherwise anonymous with the possible qualifiers \"after a work by\", \"manner of\", or \"workshop of\". These big three are important in different ways. The first one, \"after a work by\" implies there is an earlier work of the same subject and I will look it up and add it with \"based on\" and a link back with \"derivative work\". The second, \"manner of\", implies an artist who was influenced by the target artist's work (e.g. John Constable's clouds were influenced by Jacob van Ruisdael). These people are much harder to trace and track over time, but with the size of Wikidata's dataset I do believe we should be better able to do this and I am still looking for ways to capture this information. The third, \"workshop of\" is fairly specific and sometimes the hand of the master is included in this phrase specifically for some central part of the painting. When it comes to artist workshops, we are pretty good at gathering the documented members over time as artists move from one location to another. I think we should create \"studio\" items that contain documented pupils or assistants that we can use instead of anonymous. The risk is that there is nobody else doing this, because they don't have the data, so it would be an innovation. My view is the painting is either by the studio or not, and given the dating, it should be linked to the people in the studio in the period of that date. I would be willing to work on this if there was consensus.

Nearly every older painter has specific examples that need special treatment.

Perhaps it should overwrite the previous statement if it was within the same year. Thus over time, historical stats will show for each year as of date XX Dec XXXX.

By using the male form in Wikidata as a label we reinforce the idea that authors or filmmakers are male by default.\n* This may reinforce the idea that Wikidata is dominated by male contributors. Women coming to Wikidata may feel excluded from the community because there is a wide use of male form as a generic form.\n* Moreover this excludes also non binary people.\n\nFor all this reasons and many others, it would be good to use more gender inclusive language in  Wikidata.\n\nThere are several ways to do it. \n\n* Avoid nouns and use verbal forms : for instance we could replace \"auteur\" by \"\u00e9crit par\"\n* Use a combination of female and male form. This could be \"auteur/autrice\" separated by the slash or \"auteur ou autrice\". This may exclude non binary people\n* Use an inclusive form such as \"auteur\u2022rice\". This is the best solution to include men, women and non-binary people. \n\nIt would be good to have have a consensus on that topic. \n\nSee previous discussions [[Topic:Wgl2sg728eg71a8s|here]] and [[Property_talk:P170#Label_in_French_is_not_gender_neutral|here]]. \n\n[[User:PAC2|PAC2]] ([[User talk:PAC2|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:28, 21 November 2021 (UTC)\n\n:Total support thanks for opening the conversation [[User:Nattes \u00e0 chat|Nattes \u00e0 chat]] ([[User talk:Nattes \u00e0 chat|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC)\n:German has apparently the same problem as French has. Problem is that\u2014to the best of my knowledge\u2014there is not even remotely a \"standard gender inclusive German language\" that finds reasonable agreement, even among the supporters of gender inclusive language. Which makes it pretty difficult to use gender inclusive language, unfortunately.\n:So, this is a problem of (some) languages in the first place, not of Wikidata. Please also note that for data users, the gender-neutral Q-identifier is much more important than labels. In case we want to help data users to use correctly gendered labels, we should increase coverage with both {{P|P2521}} and {{P|P3321}} whereever possible/necessary, so that they do at least have the choice to use correct labels if they want to. \u2014[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=\"signature-talk\">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:50, 21 November 2021 (UTC)\n:: Yes, {{P|2521}} and {{P|3321}} are also very useful.

The Q-ID is much more important than labels. Also, labels should be clear and concise to facilitate there use. In French, the name of a profession is always given in the masculine gender, because it is the gender that acts as the neutral (according to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, the neutral, in French, takes the forms of the unmarked gender, i.e. the masculine). So for me, the current solution of labeling an item with the masculine gender and aliasing it with the feminine gender is the best solution.\n::::For me, the last two solutions are not desirable. Putting both genders in the label would reduce the readability and therefore the efficiency of the labels. Using the middle point is not a widespread use and is much debated in the French-speaking world. The French Academy is against it, as well as the French Ministry of Education.\n::::Maybe the first proposition (avoid nouns and use verbal forms) can be a solution, but again, I think it's less efficient.

First, Q-id is useful for machines but humans think with words and therefore use labels.

The French Ministry of Education recommends to use both feminine and male form (\"Il est \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 des formulations telles que \u00ab le candidat ou la candidate \u00bb afin de ne pas marquer de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence de genre, ou \u00e0 des formules telles que \u00ab les inspecteurs et les inspectrices de l'\u00e9ducation nationale \u00bb pour rappeler la place des femmes dans toutes les fonctions.\", https://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/21/Hebdo18/MENB2114203C.htm). But moreover, knowledge equity is a central pillar of the Wikimedia movement's strategy (https://wikimediafoundation.org/our-work/open-the-knowledge/#a1-help-us-achieve-knowledge-equity). It's important to use a language which does not exclude women and non binary people.

Cet argument ne me semble pas oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la mesure.\n* Le masculin est neutre et englobe tous les genres : cet argument est contest\u00e9 par plusieurs Wikidatistes, avec apport de sources scientifiques montrant que le masculin n'est pas v\u00e9ritablement neutre dans la perception commune du lectorat.

Son bien-fond\u00e9 est assez largement accept\u00e9 ; c'est plus sa mise en pratique technique qui soul\u00e8ve quelques oppositions. En attendant qu'une \u00e9ventuelle solution technique jug\u00e9e meilleure (comme celle propos\u00e9e en [[phabricator:T249447|T249447]]) soit mise en place, la proposition de PAC2 est accept\u00e9e.
