87961,"My overall opinion of your accusations is that you have taken a very one-dimensional perspective of only those facts that interest you, and which you seem to wish to repackage. You only choose to hear what you want to hear, not necessarily what is being said to you, then you seem to fill up a conversation with something between hyperbole and rhetoric, yet everyone else has to watch their p's and q's with you. You simply don't know all the facts.
* re problem 1. Correct, and that is a matter that is being addressed, and as you state it is WMF wide. At this point in time there are no restrictions placed upon the person by WMF, nor the stewards (the accounts is not locked or globally blocked [http://toolserver.org/~vvv/sulutil.php?rights=1&user=Poetlister] [http://toolserver.org/~vvv/sulutil.php?rights=1&user=Quillercouch]. Others have covered that matter in detail.
* re problem 2. Pathoschild has addressed this matter.
* re problem 3. I have never met John, I have spoken to him once on the telephone for less than 3 minutes about a matter unconnected with anything administrative. At best an acquaintance through WMF with whom I communicate, and helped me to learn the ropes of Wikisource and wikis in general, for which I am very thankful for his giving me the time and guidance, and I would happily sit down and share a coffee with him. Is that a problem? Is that evil or wrong? I don't think so. FWIW I have attended one wikimeet when a person from WMF in US came to Australia, and I wanted to hear her speak.  And do you know what? I really shouldn't have to explain or defend an attendance at WMF function or related function, that should be seen as a good thing. Sheesh! To your collapsing of the rest of the discussion to that format, I would discount that as an inadequate summation, more like a selective trimming of components to suit an argument.
* re problem 4. Are you proposing that we now start to codify morals, respect, truth-telling, etc. There is a policy that has some blackletter law, though we all know that it is not a complete document to govern the operations of a wiki, and we start to use our knowledge of cultural aspects and our life-learning of morals, respect, etc., and, dare I say, common-sense and experience of the existing values of the community.
* re your conclusion. We actually do have a community, and one that actually tries to cooperate, to be welcoming, compassionate, understanding, helpful, and productive, and one that tries not to import wikidramas. I see that as a good thing, and would hope that all WMF sites are trying for that style of community. And do you know what?  When I said something about ""we the community would address the issue"" that is exactly what I meant, and if you look, the community has started to address the matter, and we aren't in drama about it.  We will calmly and politely work to a resolution to true and tried community processes.
Personally, I see you appear within a community, or in an IRC, dragging in your collective umbrage or issue of the day and strew it about like [[wikt:burley|burley]] on the water, and it seems you have an expectation that we should all be jiggling around to your issue, at your timetable. In answer, no. We will attempt to follow a due process, provide natural justice to those who need it, and progress deliberately.<p>As mentioned we do have the occasional tiff, there is no perfection, and being humans we exhibit normal behaviours, and these include lapses, mistakes and slips, all factors in [[w:human reliability|human reliability]] and human error.

92142,"This is a request for a global ban of User:Ottava Rima. I'll keep it concise, you all know him. The user has currently zero content contribution to Wikimedia projects and instead contributes a huge lot of harassment and other disruption.
Criteria
Cross-wiki abuse: the user has demonstrated a permanent pattern of severe disruption in all the projects he has been active in.
Carefully informed: countless herds of editors, sysop etc. of the Wikimedia projects have invested time trying to educate Ottava Rima to a civil and productive interaction. Multiple blocks have been discussed, applied, lifted, re-applied etc. in an endless series.
Banned: the user has been banned and indefinitely blocked since a few years ago on the English Wikipedia by their ArbCom and no revision is to be expected ; he is also indef-blocked on Commons (with unanimous support) after a January 2012 indef-block has been restored for blatantly disrespecting unblock reasons  . His reaction to this has only been to continue his habit to question the mental ability of others to understand English, policies, their own words etc. The English Wikipedia was the only project where he had content contributions, if I remember correctly.
Continued risk: now that he is blocked on Commons we can expect to migrate his disruption to another project as he always does. His activity is focused on few wikis but has broad targets and never stops except for dishonest acknowledgements of mistakes to get unblocked, which he later rescinds. All those who disagree with him are either criminals, or abusers, or people with mental deficiencies.
Example reasons for ban
Really, there are so many that I'll just use the examples from the policies.
 Harassment: 15px|link= Done, he's a real specialist. He is assisted by several off-platforms and cliques; his activity on our wikis is instrumental to facilitate external attacks against the Wikimedia projects, often focusing on harassment and personal attack of the most involved editors.
 Identity theft: perhaps not literally, but he is a specialist of misrepresenting the other editors' words both for the purposes of derailing discussions and for harassing and damaging them in all possible venues when they disagree with him on some dispute.
 Privacy policy: I won't dig all the history now and I might be wrong but in order to achieve all the above deeds the user happened to mishandle private information or correspondence in different venues.

There is, as yet, no clear need to have a larger train wreck. On the other hand, any user can notify other wikis of this discussion.

As advised, then, the WMF leads the community, and the sign of leadership is that the community follows. If force is required, that's not leadership, it's something else. So how does the WMF lead without controlling? It's easily said, at least: be advised by the community, it will tell us what it needs and what it will follow.

When you open the main page of Wikipedia, you immediately see this statement: ""Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia"", but unfortunately, we ran into the opposite meaning of this statement in Russian Wikipedia.

Falun Gong is a peaceful meditation practice which originated in China. It has been widely spreading since 1992 in China as well as many other countries. In 1999 the Chinese government began to illegally persecute the followers of this teaching. Many are wondering: why are they being persecuted? Falun Gong became very popular in the 1990s in China, and the number of people practicing Falun Gong even exceeded the number of members of the Communist Party. This practice was banned in China because of its growing popularity, and because the main principles of Falun Gong (Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance) are opposite of the ideology of struggle and violence promoted by the party.

To justify the repression of Falun Gong, the Chinese authorities fabricated the so-called self-immolation incident in Tiananmen Square in Beijing and many other false ""facts."" After that, the label ""heretic sect"" was placed on Falun Gong. 

The information about Falun Gong can be found in Wikipedia in 43 languages, but only in the article about Falun Gong in Russian Wikipedia, one can find the term ""sect"" in relation to this practice. Also, large portion of the article consists of false information. For example, the article falsefully states that Falun Gong practitioners are ripping their stomachs out and burning themselves, killing relatives, and how in the homeland of Falun Gong the government is ""good"" to Falun Gong practitioners, and how the government is ""painlessly"" helping practitioners abandon the practice. Even the existence of the persecution of Falun Gong and the extraction of organs from innocent practitioners is being questioned https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Фалуньгун

It started when in 2013, almost simultaneously in the history of revisions of the article about Falun Gong, three members appeared - Tempus, Kroniker and Cathy. They immediately began to pour negative information into the article about Falun Gong, which fuels the hatred in the society towards this practice and its followers. Here is the history of edits and clear evidence of appearance of the word ""sect"" in the preamble: . 

Every time other participants tried to make any corrections to the article, these members canceled all the edits in the matter of a few minutes. The history of the article from 2013 shows that it is impossible to find any compromise or consensus with these participants, they openly bend the rules and prevent neutral and meaningful information based on authoritative sources, from being added to the article about Falun Gong  than violate the rule WP:CONS.

Prior to appearance of these participants in 2013, article about Falun Gong in Russian Wikipedia did not contain so many [lieshttps://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Фалуньгун&diff=55871314&oldid=55439918] .

In 2015, Tim Vtln has attempted to introduce a neutral version of the article , which was written with consideration of authoritative sources. This article neutrally outlines the information about the ban of Falun Gong in China and about organ harvesting. In general, Tim’s article explained in an impartial way what Falun Gong is. I think that this option could satisfy both sides of the conflict. However, Tempus, Cathy and Kroniker were not satisfied with this version, as for them, the neutrality of the article is not important and they have deleted the article within three hours .

Unfortunately, the Wikipedia community in Russia is ignoring this issues and makes no effort to help in any way to solve this problem.

Appeals to the administrators forum did not yield any results: 
The appeals to the mediators and to the Arbitration Committee also did not help,
Here are the answers of the mediators:

The Arbitration Committee rejects applications, commenting on this statement:
“The Arbitration Committee does not work on the content of the articles, including the enforcement of rules on neutrality, on original research, on the weightiness of the presentation, and other matters. Improvements of the articles are reached through the search for consensus and constructive interaction on the pages of discussions.” .   

All methods to resolve the conflict were exhausted. At the Wiki conference in Moscow in 2016, a Wikipedia participant asked Jimmy Wales about the violation of Wikipedia rules in an article about Falun Gong: 

Recently, we learned that Russian Wikipedia has a group of so-called ""anti-cultists"", led by the famous ""sectarian"" Mr. A. Dvorkin, who controls the content of articles about religious themes.
In the film -vorikiviki-pedia-chast- first.html ""Orthodox Lobby in Russian Wikipedia"", this situation is described in detail, and reflects the real current situation in Russian Wikipedia.

Dear world community of Wikipedia!
This situation related to Falun Gong is not only about Russian citizens, followers of this self-improvement practice. Wikimedia's office receives numerous complaints about the content related to the article about Falun Gong in Russian Wikipedia from around the world.

Please draw attention to this problem that concerns a large number of people practicing Falun Gong in many countries around the world. The content of the article about Falun Gong in Russian Wikipedia, offends the honor and dignity of thousands of Russian-speaking people around the world. They are looking forward to your righteous actions towards this matter and hope you can help clean out Russian Wikipedia from the slander and defamation reflected at the present time in the article about Falun Gong in Russian Wikipedia.  --",Lana Lin,meta.wikimedia,Requests for comment/The incitement of hatred in Russian Wikipedia towards Falun Gong,https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki?curid=10415025,,,,,,,,,,,

With regards to the current Poetlister situation, as I knew that there were emails sent by Poetlister using false email addresses, I have not been attentive enough over course of the last year to the developing Poetlister problem, and should have done more to preempt and prevent this, or ensure it was better understood by more stewards and checkusers.

With regards to the broader concerns that the English Wikisource community can't deal with this, that decision should be made after the community has had a chance to do so.  The English Wikisource community hasn't previously developed many policies because we don't regularly see these types of problem on Wikisource, so they are typically dealt with on a case by case basis.  As this is now a recurring problem on Wikisource, I am confident that the English Wikisource community will undertake to resolve this current situation and ensure that it can't happen again.

I would also welcome any steward decision that the Poetlister problem now warrants a global ban, which would remove the need for the community to develop policy to deal with this special case.

About CU: why you were in such a hurry? Hr.wiki'd choose it's CU's in few weeks, those edits wouldn't be lost for CU. Why you were bypassing hr.wiki? Don't you trust hr.wiki community? Anyway, Wikimedia is explicit about users' privacy and the usage of CU tools. You have your rights, but don't allow someone to make you someone's wish-fullfiller. You have those tools, it's you who ""pushes the button"". Don't allow anyone to manipulate with you. Rather don't use the tools.

I cannot know somebody's nationality, I can only guess. Someone might pretend to be of certain nationality. Finally, I don't block nor attack people because of their origin. I block only the users that show attacking behaviour. I cannot know their origin. Take a better look: have I blocked every Serb or Bosniak that appeared on hr.wiki? I haven't. In fact, I had correspondence with several users that claim (or it seems) that are Serbs or Bosniaks. And that correspondence wasn't insult war, but cooperation. If you follow, as you say, than you'll know what I've just said. If I disagree with someone, that's not a reason to call me ""chauvinist"". <br>
If you disagree with the content, you're welcome to comment on the talkpages and contribute in the articles, just like anyone. Dungodung, am I chauvinist because I've been writing about <u>the Serbs that everyone forgot</u>: the loyal Croatian Serbs that were brutally killed by greaterserbianists?

About ""xenophobe"": I had so much cooperation with users from abroad, that nooone has right to tell me such words. So much cooperation in the mainspace and articletalk area (not just on hr.wiki).<br>

83956,"The present project nahwiki is named according to a situation that existed many years ago, when nahwiki included many official written forms of Nahuatl, which are nci – Classical Nahuatl, nhn – Central Nahuatl, nch – Central Huasteca Nahuatl, ncx – Central Puebla Nahuatl, naz – Coatepec Nahuatl, nln – Durango Nahuatl, nhe – Eastern Huasteca Nahuatl, ngu – Guerrero Nahuatl, azz – Highland Puebla Nahuatl, nhq – Huaxcaleca Nahuatl, nhk – Isthmus-Cosoleacaque Nahuatl, nhx – Isthmus-Mecayapan Nahuatl, nhp – Isthmus-Pajapan Nahuatl, ncl – Michoacán Nahuatl, nhm – Morelos Nahuatl, nhy – Northern Oaxaca Nahuatl, ncj – Northern Puebla Nahuatl, nht – Ometepec Nahuatl, nlv – Orizaba Nahuatl, ppl – Pipil language, nhz – Santa María la Alta Nahuatl, npl – Southeastern Puebla Nahuatl, nhc – Tabasco Nahuatl, nhv – Temascaltepec Nahuatl, nhi – Tenango Nahuatl, nhg – Tetelcingo Nahuatl, nuz – Tlamacazapa Nahuatl, nhw – Western Huasteca Nahuatl, nsu – Sierra Negra Nahuatl, and xpo – Pochutec. The language code <code>nah</code> can be interpreted as a common code for [[w:Nahuatl language]], or what is called the collection code. When [[incubator:Wp/nhn|Central Nahuatl]], [[incubator:Wp/nch|Huasteca Nahuatl]], [[incubator:Wp/ngu|Guerrero Nahuatl]], [[incubator:Wp/ncj|Northern Pueblea Nahuatl]], [[incubator:Michoacan Nahuatl]], [[incubator:Wp/nlv|Orizaba Nahuatl]], and [[incubator:Wp/ppl|Pipil]] split off to become a project written solely in these modern Nahuatl languages, nahwiki continued to use the collection code instead of switching to the individual code <code>nci</code>, which is the correct code for Classical Nahuatl.

There were two main arguments for this. Partly a ""peace offer"" from these modern Nahuatl languages that nahwiki could continue to use <code>nah</code> as language code, and partly (and more importantly) that Nahuatl language by some is considered to also consist of the unofficial, conservative forms of many so-called other forms of Classical and modern Nahuatls, which are, respectively, [[w:Pipil language]] and [[w:Huasteca Nahuatl]]. The differences to these modern Nahuatl language forms may be confusing to some, but while Pipil was quite seldom in use at that time Huasteca Nahuatl was more common.

One of the main driving forces behind use of Pipil was, and partly is, the newspaper [[w:Aztecs]]. This newspaper used Pipil as its language, but then in 2006 it created its own version of Pipil and called the new language version ""Modern Nahuatl"". This started a slide among users of Pipil from the previously conservative version to a more moderate version. At the other side ordinary Classical Nahuatl started a slide towards this Modern Nahuatl. In the latest version of ordinary Classical Nahuatl from 2012 the differences between Classical Nahuatl and Pipil has become almost insignificant. 

For all practical purposes there are no difference between Classical Nahuatl and Pipil, and even for Nahuatls the difference is next to impossible to spot. Most of the time when someone complains about changes to an article on nahwiki that is said to be Huasteca Nahuatl it is simply an article written by some mixture of old Classical Nahuatl and local common dialects. This is hefty reputed by people from the Huasteca Nahuatl movement.

Some say harshly that Pipil peoples and Classical Nahuatl has been moved towards Pipil, but it is still called Classical Nahuatl. Some say there are still eight important differences, some say about 40, whatever is correct the differences has become infinitesimal for languages in common use. Still note that there are a lot of articles on the net that describe the status as it existed in late 1990.

It is only as a content language Pipil is somewhat used, but the pages with Pipil is not marked in any way. It will probably not be possible to identify by automatic means which pages is truly Pipil, most of the terms that can be used as identificators will be just noise, and there will be no clear winner even for articles which are said to be written in a specific language form. It is simply not possible to identify any clear distinction between them after a few revisions.

The interface language at nahwiki is more or less pure Classical Nahuatl, and the language code in use are <code>nci</code> that is Classical Nahuatl. There are no interface language for Pipil. The project use <code>nci</code> as its default language.

In short, the reason why the <code>nah</code> language code is used on nahwiki is simply a continuation from the split between nahwiki and incubator wikis. There are no real reason why the code is <code>nah</code> and not the more proper <code>nci</code>.

**I am a Wikimedian in Residence at a University School of Data Science. Part of what I do is edit Wikidata. I am happy to disclose.
**I look at OpenStreetMap and see huge volunteer community encroachment by paid editors. I predict the same will happen to Wikidata. I think Wikidata needs some policy in place to prevent corporate capture of the sort that OpenStreetMap experienced. Wikidata is much more susceptible to commercial takeover than Wikipedia because contributors are relatively fewer and business editors have much more financial backing.
**I have no idea what kinds of conflicts Wikidata currently experiences with commercial editors.
**I wish to avoid or prevent unclear or miscommunication that English Wikipedia and others have had in this space. In my opinion, ""paid editing"" is a poor choice of term, because it conflates editing to share general knowledge from a library or university with editing to do marketing and promotion for public relations. To me these are different enough to merit different terms, but the custom in English Wikipedia is that too often, paid university librarians get grouped as ""paid editors"" along with sleazy marketers, when I think we should lower barriers of access for librarians but raise barriers of access for marketers. I prefer some term like ""paid promotion"" versus ""sponsored editing"", where both perform disclosure but otherwise have different expectations.

There is a significant amount of people who show up one day a year, make a bunch of jokes, and don't come back until next year.
Too many people submit more than 1 XfD. Less people comment on them because there are so many.
The XFDs tend to distract from the higher effort jokes like Wikipedia:Featured sentences, Wikipedia:WikiProject Users, etc.
Many jokes are the same every year (whether known or not)... and when they aren't, they are about something terrible like WW3 or COVID.
In my opinion, users should be limited to a single joke for the day (then they can only engage with other people's jokes). That would make the year page a lot less crowded and entertaining.

47987,"I've read MOS:DEADNAME and I think this guideline is troublesome for the purpose and general policies of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not supposed to be picking sides in a culture or in this case gender conflict, we should only be reporting what reliable sources say. Right now MOS:DEADNAME says ""gendered words (e.g. pronouns, ""man/woman"", ""waiter/waitress"") that reflect the person's latest expressed gender self-identification as reported in the most recent reliable sources, even if it does not match what is most common in sources,"" This is Wikipedia picking a side on a controversial issue, which violates the NPOV. I think the gendered words in an article should be a reflection of the gendered words used in recent reliable sources. Right now most reliable sources will use the pronouns that the individual prefers; however, lets say in 10yrs from now reliable sources want to call transgender people by the pronouns corresponding to their biological sex, then Wikipedia should follow along with RS and not mess around with what the individual prefers. Under the current guideline, in that example we would continue to use what was recently reported as the persons preference. That would be a violation of the nuetral point of view of Wikipedia, we shouldn't be deciding what gendered words are used based on what we think is respectful or kind, it should be what's used in reliable sources. As for this, ""This holds for any phase of the person's life, unless they have indicated a preference otherwise"", it should remain except for the 2nd clause as I explained above. It would be too confusing for writers to correspond their old life with their old pronouns. I think the whole article should reflect what is used in the most recent sources. The point that the person's old name shouldn't be used at all unless they were formerly notable with it is not in accordance with Wikipedia's policy under [[WP:NNC]]. When deciding whether or not a transgender person's ""dead name"" should be included we should use normal standards expected under [[WP:WEIGHT]] and [[WP:CONPOL]], the decision to include the dead name shouldn't be decided by the Wikipedia communities belief that dead naming is bad, but by weight and coverage in reliable sources. I hope my explanation will help you rationalize some of the propositions below


Proposition A:change ""gendered words (e.g. pronouns, ""man/woman"", ""waiter/waitress"") that reflect the person's latest expressed gender self-identification as reported in the most recent reliable sources, even if it does not match what is most common in sources,"" to ""gendered words (e.g. pronouns, ""man/woman"", ""waiter/waitress"") should reflect what is most commonly used in the most recent reliable sources, regardless of what the person prefers under their expressed gender self-identification."" Remove ""unless they have indicated a preference otherwise""

Proposition B: change ""If a living transgender or non-binary person was not notable under a former name (a deadname), it should not be included in any page (including lists, redirects, disambiguation pages, category names, templates, etc), even in quotations, even if reliable sourcing exists. Treat the pre-notability name as a privacy interest separate from (and often greater than) the person's current name."" to ""When deciding if a living transgender or non-binary person's former name (dead name) should be included in any page (including lists, redirects, disambiguation, category names, templates, etc), it should be established that their are reliable sources that mention the former name and that including the former name is proper under [[WP:WEIGHT]]."" Change ""A living transgender or non-binary person's former name should be included in the lead sentence of their main biographical article only if they were notable under it; introduce the name with ""born"" or ""formerly"":"" to ""A living transgender or non-binary person's former name should be included in the lead sentence of their main biographical article if their birth or former name is in reliable sources and inclusion is appropriate under [[WP:WEIGHT]]:""

Proposition C Change ""In articles on works or other activity by a living trans or non-binary person before transition, use their current name as the primary name (in prose, tables, lists, infoboxes, etc.), unless they prefer their former name be used for past events."" to ""In articles on works or other activity by a living trans or non-binary person before transition, use their current name as the primary name (in prose, tables, lists, infoboxes, etc.), unless the most recent reliable sources are using something different and there appears to be an explicit or compelling reason for this.""

The rest appears ok, if any of these propositions were passed some examples might need to be changed.

But weight is more than just the numerical quantity of sources, it's about the quality of sources. I've run into this a lot recently in writing about the american civil war: it's one of the most written about topics in the English language. To poll the opinion of even a fraction of sources would be impossible. So instead the resident editors have chosen a handful of the very best books on the subject and used them to break ties/be authoritative. Now, using that approach is a little harder here because there are no Pulitzer winning books about trans women (as far as I can tell).

#  Support as best alternative to ""Religion: None"" and ""Religion: Atheist"". Atheist is not the antonym of Religious, because of plural irreligiosity, as Ëzhiki suggests, as well as atheistic religionism. Using ""Religion: None"" as a synonym for atheism seems to push a certain dogmatic interpretation. ""Religion: Atheist"" unnecessarily pushes the opposite dogma. Omitting the parameter seems quite acceptable in cases where religious opinion does not constitute an important or well-established part of a person's identity.

For instance, all of the following are commonly held to be pseudoscientific: [[perpetual motion]], [[Lysenkoism]], [[phrenology]], and [[homeopathy]]. I note here that it's pretty easy actually to falsify any of these theories, and in fact the reason they're commonly considered pseudoscientific is that they are false.

If anybody would talk to him in the middle of the process and tell him that what he was doing was not ok he would likely stop doing it.
